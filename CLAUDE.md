    - **Adaptive Rolling Window** ✅: Position-specific lookback periods
      - QB: 5 games, RB: 3 games, WR: 4 games, TE: 4 games
      - Balances stability vs responsiveness by position
    - **Percentile-Based Floors** ✅: 15th percentile of actual outcomes
      - More realistic than linear σ-based floors
      - Example: Sam Darnold floor 150 yds (actual) vs ~188 yds (linear)
  - **Phase 3 Enhancements:** (2 of 4 complete)
    - **Data Validation Suite** ✅: Pre-flight validation before processing
      - Validates game data, teams, player counts, stat thresholds
      - Warnings for incomplete data, errors prevent execution if critical
    - **Injury Filter** ✅: Excludes OUT/DOUBTFUL, flags QUESTIONABLE
      - Batch queries player_injury_status table
      - Shows excluded players summary and injury warnings
      - Ready for production when injury data populated
  - **Script stats:** 780+ lines (was 449), ~800ms per game, 10 enhancements implemented
  - Handles bye weeks, minimum games requirement, position-based stat categories
  - Displays top fantasy starters (1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE) with opponent matchup indicators
  - Usage: `npm run floors -- --week=7` or `npm run floors -- --game=espn-401772816`
- ✅ **Created Player Props Calculator**
  - calculate-performance-floors-props.js: Betting props format (349 lines)

  - Floor/Expected/Ceiling projections for each prop type
  - Sorted by expected value within categories
  - Usage: `npm run floors:props -- --week=7`
- ✅ **Identified Schema Knowledge Gap**
  - **ISSUE**: Column name mismatch (`receptions` vs `receiving_receptions`)
  - Wasted 15-30 minutes debugging preventable schema errors
  - Root cause: Schema knowledge not embedded in agent training/context

### Session 6 (October 21, 2025 - Game-Day Roster Infrastructure):
- ✅ **Created Game-Day Roster Architecture (Phase 1)**
  - Workorder: WO-GAME-DAY-ROSTER-TRACKING-001
  - Migration 20250101000022: Created `game_rosters` table
    - Tracks game-day roster snapshots (active/inactive per game)
    - Columns: game_id, season, team_id, player_id, position, jersey_number, active, status
    - Foreign keys to teams and players tables
    - Note: Cannot FK to partitioned games table in PostgreSQL (validated at application level)
  - **Purpose**: Historical roster tracking - players who appeared in games but were later released/traded
  - Solves FK constraint violations when players are missing from players table
- ✅ **Created Player Auto-Creation Utility (Phase 1)**

  - scripts/backfill-missing-players.js (60 lines)
  - Designed to add 12 missing players from FK errors (espn-2978935, espn-4034953, etc.)
  - Uses player-creator utility with 1 req/sec rate limit
  - **Result**: All 12 players already existed (added via earlier add-missing-players-by-id.js run)
  - npm script: `npm run backfill:missing-players`
- ✅ **Enhanced Game Stats Scraper with Auto-Player-Creation (Phase 2)**

  - Identified 5 major strengths (Empirical Bayes, player-specific factors, winsorization)
  - Identified 5 critical weaknesses (time series independence, position-agnostic matchups)
  - Generated 8 actionable improvements across 3 priority tiers
  - **Expected Impact**: 35-50% cumulative accuracy improvement
- ✅ **Created PERFORMANCE-FLOORS-V5-PLAN.md (Comprehensive Enhancement Roadmap)**
  - **High Priority Improvements** (3 tasks, 28 hours):
    1. Position-Specific Defensive Matchups (20-30% impact, 10h)
       - WR vs CB1, RB vs run defense, QB vs pressure
       - Replace total yards with position-specific defensive metrics
       - Add database columns for receiving_yards_allowed_rb/wr/te
    2. Block Bootstrap for Time Series (25-35% impact, 12h)
       - Fixes autocorrelation assumption violation
       - Moving block bootstrap preserves streaks/momentum
       - Expected: Floor hit rate 65% → 80%
    3. Dynamic RB Efficiency Rates (12-18% impact, 6h)
       - Rolling 4-6 game efficiency with Empirical Bayes shrinkage
       - Replaces season-long averages that miss role changes
  - **Medium Priority Improvements** (3 tasks, 25 hours):
    4. Game Script Volume Adjustment (15-20% impact, 8h)
       - Incorporate Vegas lines (spreads, over/under)
       - Adjust RB/WR volume by implied game flow
    5. Time-Aware Trend Detection (8-12% impact, 7h)
       - Exponential decay weighting by actual days
       - Accounts for bye weeks and opponent strength
    6. Red Zone Efficiency Modeling (10-15% impact, 10h)
       - Separate red zone vs field TD rates
       - Hierarchical Bayesian priors per position
  - **Low Priority Improvements** (2 tasks, 20 hours):
    7. Defensive Injury Impact (5-8% impact, 12h)
    8. Role Stability Factor (5-8% impact, 8h)
  - **Total Estimated Effort**: 73 hours (~2 weeks)
  - **Implementation Phases**:
    - Phase 1: Core Statistical Fixes (28h) - 40-60% of gains
    - Phase 2: Context Enhancement (25h) - 30-40% of gains
    - Phase 3: Polish (20h) - 10-15% of gains
- ✅ **Documented V5 Statistical Methodology**
  - **Academic Citations**: Politis & White (2004) block bootstrap, Lahiri (2003) dependent data
  - **Critical Mathematical Fixes**:
    - Opponent factor variance calculation edge case (n=1)
    - Bootstrap CI width adjustment for autocorrelation
    - Trend factor weighting by opponent strength
  - **Configuration Additions**: 4 new config sections (block_bootstrap, game_script, position_priors)
  - **Database Schema Requirements**: 7 new columns for position-specific defense
  - **Testing Plan**: Historical backtesting (Weeks 8-17, 2024 season)
- ✅ **V5 Success Metrics Defined**
  - Overall MAE: 8.5 pts → 5.5-6.5 pts (24-35% improvement)
  - Floor Hit Rate: 65-70% → 78-82% (+10-15%)
  - QB MAE: 7.2 → 5.0 pts (31% improvement)
  - RB MAE: 9.8 → 6.5 pts (34% improvement)
