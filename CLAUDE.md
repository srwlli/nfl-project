    - **Percentile-Based Floors** ✅: 15th percentile of actual outcomes
      - More realistic than linear σ-based floors
      - Example: Sam Darnold floor 150 yds (actual) vs ~188 yds (linear)
  - **Phase 3 Enhancements:** (2 of 4 complete)
    - **Data Validation Suite** ✅: Pre-flight validation before processing
      - Validates game data, teams, player counts, stat thresholds
      - Warnings for incomplete data, errors prevent execution if critical
    - **Injury Filter** ✅: Excludes OUT/DOUBTFUL, flags QUESTIONABLE
      - Batch queries player_injury_status table
      - Shows excluded players summary and injury warnings
      - Ready for production when injury data populated
  - **Script stats:** 780+ lines (was 449), ~800ms per game, 10 enhancements implemented
  - Handles bye weeks, minimum games requirement, position-based stat categories
  - Displays top fantasy starters (1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 TE) with opponent matchup indicators
  - Usage: `npm run floors -- --week=7` or `npm run floors -- --game=espn-401772816`
- ✅ **Created Player Props Calculator**
  - calculate-performance-floors-props.js: Betting props format (349 lines)
  - Displays individual stat lines (Pass Yds, Rush Yds, Rec Yds, Receptions, TDs)
  - Floor/Expected/Ceiling projections for each prop type
  - Sorted by expected value within categories
  - Usage: `npm run floors:props -- --week=7`
- ✅ **Identified Schema Knowledge Gap**
  - **ISSUE**: Column name mismatch (`receptions` vs `receiving_receptions`)
  - Wasted 15-30 minutes debugging preventable schema errors
  - Root cause: Schema knowledge not embedded in agent training/context
- ✅ **Created Comprehensive Schema Documentation**
  - **DATABASE-SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md** (600+ lines): Human-readable schema docs
    - All 75 player_game_stats columns with exact names and types
    - Common mistakes section with ❌ vs ✅ examples
    - Schema verification queries
    - Troubleshooting guide
  - **coderef/schema-reference.json** (500 lines): Programmatic schema reference
    - Notes which scripts use which tables
    - Critical warnings highlighted (receptions, primary_position, team_abbr)
    - Complete column definitions with types, examples, nullability
    - Stat categories grouped (passing, rushing, receiving, defense, etc.)
    - Common query patterns for each table
    - Usage examples from actual scripts
  - **coderef/training/database-schema-map.json** (910 lines): Auto-generated schema dump
    - Generated from live database via `npm run schema:map`
    - 248 columns across 18 tables documented
    - Sample data from each table
    - Update anytime schema changes
  - **scripts/generate-schema-map.js** (100 lines): Auto-generate schema tool
    - Queries live database for actual column names and types
    - Outputs to coderef/training/database-schema-map.json
    - Run weekly or after migrations
- ✅ **Created MCP Agent Instructions**
  - **MCP-AGENT-SCHEMA-INSTRUCTIONS.md** (400+ lines): Complete implementation guide
  - 6 major components to fix schema knowledge at root:
    1. Schema training document template (coderef/training/database-schema.json)
    2. `verify_schema` tool specification
    3. Agent prompt updates with schema verification
    4. Auto-generated schema map script (implemented!)
    5. Schema linting for code generation
    6. Documentation index updates
  - 10-item implementation checklist
  - Test cases and success metrics
  - Expected outcome: Zero schema-related errors in future code generation
- ✅ **Enhanced Documentation & Discovery**
  - Updated PROJECT-MAP.md with schema reference warnings
  - Made DATABASE-SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md highly discoverable
  - Added npm scripts: `floors:props` and `schema:map`
  - Created SESSION-5-SUMMARY.md (complete session documentation)
