(node:14752) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Users/willh/Desktop/projects%20-%20current-location/coderef-system/packages/generators/dist/index.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Users\willh\Desktop\projects - current-location\coderef-system\packages\generators\package.json.
