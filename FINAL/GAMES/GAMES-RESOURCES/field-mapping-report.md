## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ WRONG Queries

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Forgetting season partition
.eq('game_id', gameId)  // Must include season for performance

// ❌ WRONG - Not handling NULL quarter scores
.order('home_q1_score', { ascending: false })  // Scheduled games have NULL

// ❌ WRONG - Wrong FK reference syntax
.select('home_team(team_name)')  // Should specify FK constraint name

// ❌ WRONG - Checking for "completed" status
.eq('status', 'completed')  // Should be 'final'
```

### ✅ CORRECT Queries

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Include season partition
.eq('game_id', gameId)
.eq('season', 2025)

// ✅ CORRECT - Filter out NULL quarter scores
.eq('status', 'final')
.not('home_q1_score', 'is', null)

// ✅ CORRECT - Proper FK reference
.select('home_team:teams!games_home_team_id_fkey(team_name)')

// ✅ CORRECT - Use 'final' status
.eq('status', 'final')
```

## 7. Query Patterns for Scoreboard

### Live Scoreboard (Current Week)

```javascript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('games')
  .select(`
    game_id,
    game_date,
    game_time,
    status,
    home_team_id,
    away_team_id,
    home_score,
    away_score,
    broadcast_network,
    home_team:teams!games_home_team_id_fkey(team_abbr, logo_url),
    away_team:teams!games_away_team_id_fkey(team_abbr, logo_url)
  `)
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .eq('week', currentWeek)
  .order('game_date')
  .order('game_time')
```

### Upcoming Games

```javascript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('games')
  .select('*')
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .eq('status', 'scheduled')
  .gte('game_date', new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0])
  .order('game_date')
  .limit(10)
```

### Recent Final Scores

```javascript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('games')
  .select(`
    *,
    home_team:teams!games_home_team_id_fkey(team_name, team_abbr),
    away_team:teams!games_away_team_id_fkey(team_name, team_abbr)
  `)
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .eq('status', 'final')
  .order('game_date', { ascending: false })
  .limit(10)
```

## 8. Table Partitioning

### Partitioned By Season

**Why**: Improves query performance by limiting scans to single season

**Partitions**:
- `games_historical`: 1970-2019
- `games_2020`: 2020 season
- `games_2021`: 2021 season
- `games_2022`: 2022 season
- `games_2023`: 2023 season
- `games_2024`: 2024 season
- `games_2025`: 2025 season (current)

**Query Requirement**: Always include `season` in WHERE clause:
```javascript
.eq('season', 2025)  // Required for optimal performance
```

**Primary Key**: `(game_id, season)` - Composite key ensures uniqueness across partitions

---

## 9. Indexes

### Performance Indexes Created

1. `idx_games_season_week` - Lookup by season and week
2. `idx_games_home_team` - Lookup home games for team
3. `idx_games_away_team` - Lookup away games for team
4. `idx_games_date` - Sort by game date (DESC)
5. `idx_games_status` - Filter by game status

---

    game.home_q1_score +
    game.home_q2_score +
    game.home_q3_score +
    game.home_q4_score +
    (game.home_ot_score || 0)

  const awayQuarterTotal =
    game.away_q1_score +
    game.away_q2_score +
    game.away_q3_score +
    game.away_q4_score +
    (game.away_ot_score || 0)

  return (
    homeQuarterTotal === game.home_score &&
    awayQuarterTotal === game.away_score
  )
