# Player Creation Mechanisms

> **Purpose**: Documentation of all methods that create/update players in the database
> **Last Updated**: October 22, 2025
> **Status**: ✅ All mechanisms operational

---

## 🎯 Overview

There are **three mechanisms** that handle unknown/missing players in the database:

1. **Auto-Player Creation** (Automatic) - `scripts/utils/player-creator.js`
2. **Manual Player Addition** (Manual) - `scripts/add-missing-players-by-id.js`
3. **Roster Updates Scraper** (Automatic) - `scripts/scrapers/roster-updates-scraper.js`

---

## 1. 🤖 Auto-Player Creation (PRIMARY METHOD)

### Overview
**File**: `scripts/utils/player-creator.js` (273 lines)
**Workorder**: WO-GAME-DAY-ROSTER-TRACKING-001
**Triggered By**: `game-stats-scraper.js` during game processing
**Purpose**: Prevent FK constraint violations by auto-creating missing players

### How It Works

When the game-stats-scraper processes a game:

1. **Extract Player IDs** from ESPN game data (boxscore + rosters)
2. **Check Database** for existing players (batch query)
3. **Identify Missing Players** (not in database)
4. **Auto-Create Missing Players**:
   - Fetch from ESPN API (`/athletes/{id}`)
   - Transform to database schema
   - Upsert to `players` table
5. **Continue Processing** game stats (all players now exist)

### Code Flow

```javascript
// In game-stats-scraper.js (lines 696-720)
const playerIdsInGame = extractPlayerIdsFromGame(gameSummary)
const existingPlayerIds = await getExistingPlayers(playerIdsInGame)
const missingPlayerIds = playerIdsInGame.filter(id => !existingPlayerIds.has(id))

if (missingPlayerIds.length > 0) {
  logger.warn(`Found ${missingPlayerIds.length} missing players, auto-creating...`)

  const result = await autoCreatePlayers(missingPlayerIds, { rateLimit: 1000 })

  logger.info(`✓ Created ${result.created} players`)
  if (result.failed > 0) {
    logger.error(`⚠️ Failed to create ${result.failed} players`)
  }
}

// Now upsert player stats (all players guaranteed to exist)
await upsertBatch('player_game_stats', playerStats)
```

### Key Functions

#### 1. `extractPlayerIdsFromGame(gameData)`
**Purpose**: Extract all player IDs from ESPN game summary
**Returns**: Array of player IDs (e.g., `["espn-15818", "espn-4372085"]`)

**Sources**:
- `gameData.boxscore.players` - Player stats in boxscore
- `gameData.rosters` - Game-day rosters

```javascript
export function extractPlayerIdsFromGame(gameData) {
  const playerIds = new Set()

  // Extract from boxscore
  if (gameData.boxscore?.players) {
    for (const team of gameData.boxscore.players) {
      for (const statGroup of team.statistics) {
        for (const athlete of statGroup.athletes) {
          if (athlete.athlete?.id) {
            playerIds.add(`espn-${athlete.athlete.id}`)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  // Extract from rosters
  if (gameData.rosters) {
    for (const roster of gameData.rosters) {
      for (const player of roster.roster) {
        if (player.athlete?.id) {
          playerIds.add(`espn-${player.athlete.id}`)
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return Array.from(playerIds)
}
```

#### 2. `getExistingPlayers(playerIds)`
**Purpose**: Batch check which players exist in database
**Returns**: Set of existing player IDs
**Performance**: Single batch query instead of N individual queries

```javascript
export async function getExistingPlayers(playerIds) {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('players')
    .select('player_id')
    .in('player_id', playerIds)

  return new Set(data.map(p => p.player_id))
}
```

#### 3. `fetchPlayerFromESPN(playerId)`
**Purpose**: Fetch player data from ESPN API
**Endpoint**: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/common/v3/sports/football/nfl/athletes/{id}`
**Returns**: Transformed player object or null

**Data Transformation**:
```javascript
export async function fetchPlayerFromESPN(playerId) {
  const espnId = playerId.replace('espn-', '')
  const url = `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/common/v3/sports/football/nfl/athletes/${espnId}`

  const response = await axios.get(url)
  const athlete = response.data.athlete

  return {
    player_id: playerId,
    full_name: athlete.displayName,
    first_name: athlete.firstName,
    last_name: athlete.lastName,
    jersey_number: parseInt(athlete.jersey),
    primary_position: athlete.position?.abbreviation || 'UNK',
    height_inches: parseHeight(athlete.displayHeight),
    weight_lbs: parseInt(athlete.weight),
    college: athlete.college?.name,
    birth_date: athlete.dateOfBirth,
    headshot_url: athlete.headshot?.href,
    profile_url: athlete.links?.find(l => l.rel?.includes('playercard'))?.href,
    status: 'active',
    draft_year: athlete.draft?.year,
    draft_round: athlete.draft?.round,
    draft_pick: athlete.draft?.selection,
    metadata: {
      espn_id: espnId,
      auto_created: true,
      created_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      source: 'espn_api_athlete_endpoint'
    }
  }
}
```

#### 4. `createPlayer(player)`
**Purpose**: Upsert player to database
**Strategy**: UPSERT with conflict on `player_id`

```javascript
export async function createPlayer(player) {
  const { error } = await supabase
    .from('players')
    .upsert(player, {
      onConflict: 'player_id',
      ignoreDuplicates: false
    })

  if (error) {
    logger.error(`Failed to upsert player ${player.player_id}`)
    return false
  }

  logger.info(`✓ Upserted player ${player.full_name}`)
  return true
}
```

#### 5. `autoCreatePlayers(playerIds, options)`
**Purpose**: Orchestrate auto-creation with rate limiting
**Returns**: Results object with counts

```javascript
export async function autoCreatePlayers(playerIds, options = {}) {
  const { rateLimit = 1000 } = options

  const existingPlayerIds = await getExistingPlayers(playerIds)
  const missingPlayerIds = playerIds.filter(id => !existingPlayerIds.has(id))

  const results = {
    created: 0,
    failed: 0,
    skipped: existingPlayerIds.size,
    failedPlayers: []
  }

  for (const playerId of missingPlayerIds) {
    const playerData = await fetchPlayerFromESPN(playerId)

    if (playerData) {
      const success = await createPlayer(playerData)
      if (success) {
        results.created++
      } else {
        results.failed++
        results.failedPlayers.push(playerId)
      }
    } else {
      results.failed++
      results.failedPlayers.push(playerId)
    }

    // Rate limit: 1 request per second
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, rateLimit))
  }

  return results
}
```

### Rate Limiting
- **Default**: 1 request per second (1000ms)
- **Configurable**: Pass `{ rateLimit: 500 }` for faster (but riskier)
- **Purpose**: Avoid ESPN API rate limits

### Error Handling
- **404 Not Found**: Player doesn't exist in ESPN system (logged, skipped)
- **Network Error**: Logged, player marked as failed
- **Database Error**: Logged, player marked as failed
- **Partial Failures**: Game processing continues, failures logged

### Example Output

```
Found 73 players in game roster data
Found 3 missing players, auto-creating...
  Fetching player espn-4372085 from ESPN API...
  ✓ Fetched John Doe (espn-4372085) - WR
  ✓ Upserted player John Doe (espn-4372085)

  Fetching player espn-2978935 from ESPN API...
  ✓ Fetched Jane Smith (espn-2978935) - CB
  ✓ Upserted player Jane Smith (espn-2978935)

  Fetching player espn-4429891 from ESPN API...
  ✓ Fetched Mike Johnson (espn-4429891) - LB
  ✓ Upserted player Mike Johnson (espn-4429891)

Auto-create summary: 3 created, 0 failed, 70 skipped
✓ Upserted 73 player stat records
```

## 2. 📋 Manual Player Addition (BACKUP METHOD)

### Overview
**File**: `scripts/add-missing-players-by-id.js` (160 lines)
**Workorder**: WO-FIX-MISSING-PLAYER-DATA-001
**Triggered By**: Manual execution when specific missing players are known
**Purpose**: One-time fix for known missing player IDs

### How It Works

1. **Hardcode Player IDs** in script
2. **Run Script** manually via CLI
3. **Fetch from ESPN API** for each ID
4. **Batch Insert** to database
5. **Verify** all players were added

### Usage

```bash
node scripts/add-missing-players-by-id.js
```

### Code Structure

```javascript
const MISSING_PLAYER_IDS = [
  'espn-2978935',  // MIA @ IND (Week 1)
  'espn-4034953',  // HOU @ LAR (Week 1)
  'espn-4429891',  // LV @ NE (Week 1)
  'espn-4423367',  // DET @ GB (Week 1)
  'espn-4258197'   // BAL @ BUF (Week 1)
]

async function addMissingPlayers() {
  console.log(`Attempting to fetch ${MISSING_PLAYER_IDS.length} missing players...`)

  const players = []
  const failed = []

  for (const playerId of MISSING_PLAYER_IDS) {
    const player = await fetchPlayerFromESPN(playerId)
    if (player) {
      players.push(player)
    } else {
      failed.push(playerId)
    }

    // Rate limit: 1 req/sec
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
  }

  // Insert players into database
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('players')
    .upsert(players, {
      onConflict: 'player_id',
      ignoreDuplicates: false
    })

  // Verify they're now in database
  const { data: verification } = await supabase
    .from('players')
    .select('player_id, full_name')
    .in('player_id', MISSING_PLAYER_IDS)

  console.log(`✅ Successfully added ${verification.length}/${MISSING_PLAYER_IDS.length} players`)
}
```

### When to Use
- Known missing player IDs causing FK violations
- Bulk addition of retired/released players
- Historical data backfill
- Emergency fixes before auto-create was implemented

### Session 7 Example
**Problem**: 5 missing players caused FK violations in Week 1 scraping
**Solution**: Added player IDs to script, ran manually
**Result**: ✅ All 5 players added, Week 1 scraping succeeded

## 3. 🔄 Roster Updates Scraper (ONGOING MAINTENANCE)

### Overview
**File**: `scripts/scrapers/roster-updates-scraper.js`
**Schedule**: Daily at 5:00 PM ET (automated via scheduler)
**Purpose**: Detect roster changes (signings, releases) and auto-create new players

### How It Works

For each of 32 NFL teams:

1. **Fetch Current Roster** from ESPN API
2. **Compare with Database** player_teams table
3. **Detect Additions** (on ESPN, not in DB)
   - **Check if player exists** in `players` table
   - **If not exists**: Fetch from ESPN API and create
   - **Add to player_teams** table
   - **Log transaction** in `roster_transactions` table
4. **Detect Removals** (in DB, not on ESPN)
   - **Update player_teams.end_season** to current season
   - **Log transaction** (released/traded)

### Code Flow

```javascript
// For each team
for (const team of teams) {
  // Fetch ESPN roster
  const espnRoster = await fetchTeamRoster(team.team_id)

  // Get database roster
  const dbRoster = await getTeamRoster(team.team_id, season)

  const espnPlayerIds = new Set(espnRoster.map(p => `espn-${p.id}`))
  const dbPlayerIds = new Set(dbRoster.map(p => p.player_id))

  // Additions: on ESPN but not in DB
  const additions = espnRoster.filter(p => !dbPlayerIds.has(`espn-${p.id}`))

  for (const espnPlayer of additions) {
    const playerId = `espn-${espnPlayer.id}`

    // Check if player exists in players table
    const { data: player } = await supabase
      .from('players')
      .select('player_id')
      .eq('player_id', playerId)
      .single()

    if (!player) {
      // Player doesn't exist - CREATE IT
      logger.info(`New player detected: ${espnPlayer.displayName}`)

      const playerData = transformPlayerData(espnPlayer)
      await supabase.from('players').upsert(playerData)

      logger.info(`✓ Created player: ${espnPlayer.displayName}`)
    }

    // Add to player_teams
    await supabase.from('player_teams').insert({
      player_id: playerId,
      team_id: team.team_id,
      start_season: season,
      jersey_number: espnPlayer.jersey
    })

    // Log transaction
    await supabase.from('roster_transactions').insert({
      player_id: playerId,
      team_id: team.team_id,
      transaction_type: 'signed',
      transaction_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
    })
  }

  // Removals: in DB but not on ESPN
  const removals = dbRoster.filter(p => !espnPlayerIds.has(p.player_id))

  for (const dbPlayer of removals) {
    // Update player_teams end_season
    await supabase
      .from('player_teams')
      .update({ end_season: season })
      .eq('player_id', dbPlayer.player_id)
      .eq('team_id', team.team_id)
      .is('end_season', null)

    // Log transaction
    await supabase.from('roster_transactions').insert({
      player_id: dbPlayer.player_id,
      team_id: team.team_id,
      transaction_type: 'released',
      transaction_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]
    })
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Why Missing Players Occur

### Common Scenarios:

1. **Practice Squad Call-ups**
   - Player promoted on game day
   - Not on roster during last scraper run
   - Appears in game stats before roster update

2. **Mid-Week Signings**
   - Team signs player Wednesday
   - Roster scraper ran Tuesday
   - Player plays Sunday

3. **Injury Replacements**
   - Emergency replacement signed Saturday
   - Plays Sunday
   - Roster scraper runs Monday

4. **Trades**
   - Player traded during week
   - May play for new team before roster sync

5. **ESPN Data Lag**
   - Game stats appear before roster update
   - ESPN API inconsistency

6. **Initial Seed Incomplete**
   - ESPN roster endpoint sometimes misses players
   - Released players from other teams

---

## ✅ Current Status (Session 7 Resolution)

### Problem
5 missing players caused FK constraint violations during Week 1 scraping:
- espn-2978935 (MIA @ IND)
- espn-4034953 (HOU @ LAR)
- espn-4429891 (LV @ NE)
- espn-4423367 (DET @ GB)
- espn-4258197 (BAL @ BUF)

### Solution
1. ✅ Ran `add-missing-players-by-id.js` with 5 IDs
2. ✅ All 5 players successfully created
3. ✅ Re-ran Week 1 scraper - completed with exit code 0

### Prevention
✅ **Auto-player creation** now integrated into game-stats-scraper
- Future games will auto-create any missing players
- Zero FK violations expected going forward

   - Cache frequently accessed player data

5. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Track auto-creation metrics
   - Alert on unusual patterns
   - Daily report of new players created

---

## 📝 Metadata Tracking

All auto-created players have metadata indicating their creation source:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "espn_id": "4372085",
    "team_id": "espn-16",
    "auto_created": true,
    "created_at": "2025-10-22T14:32:18.000Z",
    "source": "espn_api_athlete_endpoint"
  }
}
```

This allows:
- **Auditing**: Track which players were auto-created vs seeded
- **Debugging**: Identify data quality issues
- **Analytics**: Understand creation patterns
