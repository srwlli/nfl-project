## üîÑ Data Flow & Maintenance

### Initial Population:
1. **Seed Script**: `scripts/seed/03-players.js`
2. **API Call**: `fetchAllRosters()` from ESPN API
3. **Transformation**: `transformPlayerData()` maps ESPN data to schema
4. **Database Insert**: Batch upsert to `players` table

### Ongoing Updates:
1. **Roster Updates Scraper**: `scripts/scrapers/roster-updates-scraper.js`
   - Runs: Daily at 5:00 PM ET
   - Detects: Player additions/releases
   - Updates: Player-team relationships in `player_teams` table
   - Tracks: Changes in `roster_transactions` table

2. **Auto-Player Creation**: Game stats scraper auto-creates missing players
   - Prevents FK constraint violations
   - Fetches player data from ESPN API on-demand

## üîß Common Queries

### Get All Active Players by Position:
```sql
SELECT player_id, full_name, jersey_number, college
FROM players
WHERE primary_position = 'QB'
  AND status = 'active'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY last_name;
```

### Search Players by Name (Fuzzy):
```sql
SELECT player_id, full_name, primary_position
FROM players
WHERE full_name ILIKE '%mahomes%'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### Get Team Roster:
```sql
SELECT p.player_id, p.full_name, p.primary_position, p.jersey_number
FROM players p
JOIN player_teams pt ON p.player_id = pt.player_id
WHERE pt.team_id = 'KC'
  AND pt.start_season <= 2025
  AND (pt.end_season IS NULL OR pt.end_season >= 2025)
  AND p.deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY p.primary_position, p.last_name;
```

### Get Player Stats Summary:
```sql
SELECT
  p.player_id,
  p.full_name,
  p.primary_position,
  COUNT(pgs.game_id) as games_played,
  SUM(pgs.passing_yards) as total_passing_yards,
  SUM(pgs.rushing_yards) as total_rushing_yards,
  SUM(pgs.receiving_yards) as total_receiving_yards
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN player_game_stats pgs ON p.player_id = pgs.player_id
WHERE pgs.season = 2025
  AND p.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY p.player_id, p.full_name, p.primary_position
ORDER BY total_passing_yards DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 10;
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Schema Notes

### Column Name Warnings:

| ‚ùå WRONG | ‚úÖ CORRECT | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `position` | `primary_position` | Most common mistake |
| `height` | `height_inches` | Always in inches |
| `weight` | `weight_lbs` | Always in pounds |
| `name` | `full_name` or `first_name`+`last_name` | Use appropriate field |

### Data Type Notes:

1. **Height Display Conversion**:
   ```javascript
   const feet = Math.floor(height_inches / 12);
   const inches = height_inches % 12;
   const display = `${feet}'${inches}"`;  // e.g., "6'2""
   ```

2. **Status Enum Values**:
   - Must be one of: `'active'`, `'injured'`, `'inactive'`, `'suspended'`
   - Database will reject other values

3. **Jersey Number Validation**:
   - Must be between 0 and 99
   - Database constraint enforces this
