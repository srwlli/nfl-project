## 4. Frontend Display Examples

### 4.1 Get All Plays for a Game

```javascript
const { data: plays } = await supabase
  .from('play_by_play')
  .select('*')
  .eq('game_id', 'espn-401772510')
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .order('play_number', { ascending: true })

// Display play-by-play
plays.forEach(play => {
  const time = formatTime(play.time_remaining_seconds)
  console.log(`Q${play.quarter} ${time}: ${play.play_description} (EPA: ${play.epa})`)
})
```

### 4.2 Get Top EPA Plays from a Game

```javascript
const { data: topPlays } = await supabase
  .from('play_by_play')
  .select(`
    *,
    team:teams(team_name, team_abbr)
  `)
  .eq('game_id', gameId)
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .order('epa', { ascending: false })
  .limit(10)

// Display explosive plays
topPlays.forEach(play => {
  console.log(`${play.team.team_abbr}: ${play.play_description} (+${play.epa.toFixed(2)} EPA)`)
})
```

### 4.3 Get Drive Summary

```javascript
const { data: drivePlays } = await supabase
  .from('play_by_play')
  .select('play_description, yards_gained, epa')
  .eq('drive_id', driveId)
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .order('play_number')

// Calculate drive stats
const totalYards = drivePlays.reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.yards_gained || 0), 0)
const totalEPA = drivePlays.reduce((sum, p) => sum + (p.epa || 0), 0)
const plays = drivePlays.length

console.log(`Drive: ${plays} plays, ${totalYards} yards, ${totalEPA.toFixed(2)} EPA`)
```

### 4.4 Get Successful Plays by Team

```javascript
const { data: successfulPlays } = await supabase
  .from('play_by_play')
  .select('*')
  .eq('possession_team_id', 'KC')
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .eq('success', true)
  .gte('epa', 1.0)
  .order('epa', { ascending: false })
  .limit(20)
```

---

## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ WRONG Queries

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Forgetting season filter
.eq('game_id', gameId)  // Must include season for partitioned table!

// ❌ WRONG - Assuming yard_line is always positive
if (yard_line > 50)  // Can be negative or 0

// ❌ WRONG - Not handling NULL EPA
const avgEPA = plays.map(p => p.epa).reduce((a, b) => a + b)  // NULLs break this

// ❌ WRONG - Using string for down
.eq('down', '3')  // Down is integer!

// ❌ WRONG - Forgetting partition key in updates
UPDATE play_by_play SET epa = 2.5 WHERE play_id = X  // Needs season!
```

### ✅ CORRECT Queries

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Always include season
.eq('game_id', gameId).eq('season', 2025)

// ✅ CORRECT - Handle yard_line range
const isRedZone = yard_line !== null && yard_line >= -20 && yard_line < 0

// ✅ CORRECT - Filter NULL EPA
const avgEPA = plays.filter(p => p.epa !== null).map(p => p.epa).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)

// ✅ CORRECT - Down as integer
.eq('down', 3)

// ✅ CORRECT - Include season in updates
UPDATE play_by_play SET epa = 2.5 WHERE play_id = X AND season = 2025
```

## 7. Query Patterns

### Get Red Zone Plays

```javascript
const { data: redZonePlays } = await supabase
  .from('play_by_play')
  .select('*')
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .gte('yard_line', -20)
  .lt('yard_line', 0)
  .in('play_type', ['pass', 'run'])
  .order('epa', { ascending: false })
```

### Calculate EPA Per Play by Team

```javascript
const { data: teamPlays } = await supabase
  .from('play_by_play')
  .select('possession_team_id, epa')
  .eq('season', 2025)
  .not('epa', 'is', null)

const teamEPA = teamPlays.reduce((acc, play) => {
  if (!acc[play.possession_team_id]) {
    acc[play.possession_team_id] = { total: 0, count: 0 }
  }
  acc[play.possession_team_id].total += play.epa
  acc[play.possession_team_id].count++
  return acc
}, {})

// Calculate average EPA per play
Object.keys(teamEPA).forEach(team => {
  teamEPA[team].avg = teamEPA[team].total / teamEPA[team].count
})
```

### Format Play Display

```javascript
const formatPlay = (play) => {
  const down = play.down ? `${play.down} & ${play.yards_to_go}` : ''
  const time = formatTime(play.time_remaining_seconds)
  const quarter = play.quarter ? `Q${play.quarter}` : ''
  const yardLine = formatYardLine(play.yard_line)
  const epa = play.epa !== null ? ` (+${play.epa.toFixed(2)} EPA)` : ''

  return `${quarter} ${time} - ${down} at ${yardLine}: ${play.play_description}${epa}`
}

const formatTime = (seconds) => {
  if (!seconds) return '0:00'
  const mins = Math.floor(seconds / 60)
  const secs = seconds % 60
  return `${mins}:${secs.toString().padStart(2, '0')}`
}

const formatYardLine = (yard_line) => {
  if (yard_line === null) return 'N/A'
  if (yard_line === 0) return '50'
  if (yard_line > 0) return `Own ${yard_line}`
  return `Opp ${Math.abs(yard_line)}`
}

// Usage
formatPlay(data[0])
// "Q3 7:38 - 2 & 7 at Own 32: P.Mahomes pass short right to T.Kelce for 15 yards (+2.15 EPA)"
```

## 8. Unique Constraint

**Composite Primary Key**: (play_id, season)

**Purpose**: Enables season-based partitioning while maintaining unique play identification.

---

## 9. Indexes

### Performance Indexes Created

1. **idx_play_by_play_game** - Lookup by game_id
   - Fast retrieval of all plays in a game
   - Includes `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` for soft-delete filtering

**Note**: Indexes are created on parent table and inherited by all partitions.

---

## 10. Validation Checklist

- [x] All 14 columns exist in database
- [x] Foreign keys to game_drives and teams properly constrained
- [x] Partitioning by season configured (7 partitions)
- [x] CHECK constraints on quarter (1-5), down (1-4), yard_line (-50 to 50)
- [x] 1 performance index created
- [x] Query patterns documented
- [x] Common mistakes documented
- [x] Related tables identified
- [x] EPA/WPA analytics documented

## 11. Maintenance Notes

### Data Sources

**Primary: nflverse Play-by-Play Data** (advanced-analytics-scraper.js)

- **URL**: https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/download/pbp/play_by_play_{season}.csv
- **Free**: No API key required
- **Format**: CSV (~100-500MB per season)
- **Fields**: 200+ columns including EPA, WPA, success, play details
- **Update Frequency**: Weekly (Tuesdays after stats corrections)

**Script**: `scripts/scrapers/advanced-analytics-scraper.js` (351 lines)
- **Function**: `downloadPlayByPlayData(season)` - Downloads CSV
- **Function**: `transformPlayByPlayData(pbpRecords)` - Maps to schema (line 84)
- **Batch Size**: 10,000 plays per batch
- **Performance**: ~60-120 seconds to process full season

### Update Frequency

- **Automated**: Weekly Tuesday 6:00 AM ET via scheduler
- **Manual**: `npm run scrape:analytics`
- **Specific Week**: `npm run scrape:analytics -- --week=7`
- **Specific Game**: `npm run scrape:analytics -- --game=401547398`

### Population Strategy

1. **Weekly Updates**: New plays added as games complete
2. **Historical Backfill**: Can backfill past seasons (2020-2024)
3. **Upsert Strategy**: Uses play_id + season as conflict key

---

## 12. Known Limitations

### 1. Table Currently Empty ⚠️

**Status**: 0 plays in database (per schema-reference.json line 402)

**Reason**: nflverse data updates weekly, awaiting first scrape

**To Populate**:
```bash
npm run scrape:analytics -- --week=7
```

**Expected First Run**: ~2 minutes to download and insert ~1,000 plays

### 2. Weekly Data Availability ⚠️

**Issue**: nflverse updates Tuesdays, so plays unavailable until ~48 hours after game.

**Impact**: Cannot get EPA/WPA data in real-time during games

**Workaround**: Use ESPN live data during games, backfill EPA/WPA on Tuesday

### 3. No Real-Time EPA Calculation ⚠️

**Issue**: Script downloads pre-calculated EPA from nflverse, doesn't calculate it

**Reason**: EPA calculation is complex (requires win probability model, expected points model)

**Future Enhancement**: Implement custom EPA calculation engine for real-time updates

### 4. Large Data Volume ⚠️

**Size**: ~45,000 plays per season × 14 columns = ~630,000 fields/season

**CSV Download**: 100-500MB per season

**Database Storage**: ~50MB per season (compressed)

**Mitigation**: Partitioning by season keeps queries fast

### 5. FK Constraint Limitation ⚠️

**Issue**: Cannot create FK to games table

**Reason**: PostgreSQL doesn't support FK from partitioned to partitioned table

**Workaround**: Application-level validation when inserting plays

---

## 13. Partition Management

### Adding New Season Partitions

```sql
-- Add partition for 2026 season
CREATE TABLE play_by_play_2026 PARTITION OF play_by_play
    FOR VALUES FROM (2026) TO (2027);
```

### Querying Specific Partition

```javascript
// Automatically uses partition when season is specified
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('play_by_play')
  .select('*')
  .eq('season', 2025)  // Only scans play_by_play_2025 partition
```

### Partition Benefits

1. **Query Performance**: Season filter uses partition pruning (scans only relevant partition)
2. **Index Size**: Smaller indexes per partition
3. **Data Management**: Can drop old seasons easily
4. **Parallel Processing**: Can process multiple seasons in parallel
