## Example Records

### Example 1: Career Rushing Milestone

```json
{
  "milestone_id": 1,
  "player_id": "espn-3139477",
  "milestone_type": "10000_career_rushing_yards",
  "milestone_value": 10000,
  "achieved_date": "2023-12-03",
  "achieved_season": 2023,
  "game_id": "espn-401547301",
  "description": "Derrick Henry becomes 32nd player in NFL history to rush for 10,000 career yards"
}
```

### Example 2: Single Game Achievement

```json
{
  "milestone_id": 2,
  "player_id": "espn-3916387",
  "milestone_type": "5_passing_tds_single_game",
  "milestone_value": 5,
  "achieved_date": "2024-09-15",
  "achieved_season": 2024,
  "game_id": "espn-401547123",
  "description": "Patrick Mahomes throws 5 TDs in Chiefs victory over Ravens"

  "description": "CJ Stroud wins NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year"
}
```

## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **This table is NOT actively populated** by current scrapers.

### What Would Be Required

1. **Milestone detection algorithm** - Analyze player_season_cumulative_stats to detect when thresholds are crossed
2. **Historical backfill** - Check career stats against milestone criteria
3. **Real-time detection** - After each game, check if any milestones were achieved
4. **Manual entry** - Awards and honors would need manual tracking or API integration

---

## Potential Use Cases

### Frontend Display

**Player profile pages:**
- Career achievements timeline
- Milestone badges
- Historical significance markers

**"Milestone Watch" widget:**
```
üéØ Derrick Henry is 127 yards away from 10,000 career rushing yards
üéØ Justin Jefferson needs 2 more receptions for 500 career catches
üéØ Patrick Mahomes is 1 TD away from 200 career passing TDs
```

**Timeline component:**
```jsx
<PlayerMilestones playerId="espn-3139477">
  <Milestone
    type="10,000 Career Rushing Yards"
    date="December 3, 2023"
    game="vs Ravens"
  />
  <Milestone
    type="2,000 Yards in a Season"
    date="December 29, 2020"
    game="vs Texans"
  />
</PlayerMilestones>
```

## Implementation Strategy (If Needed)

### Phase 1: Career Milestone Detection

```javascript
// scripts/detect-milestones.js (hypothetical)

const CAREER_MILESTONES = {
  passing: [10000, 20000, 30000, 40000, 50000, 60000, 70000],
  rushing: [5000, 10000, 15000, 20000],
  receiving: [5000, 10000, 15000],
  touchdowns: [100, 200, 300, 400, 500],
  sacks: [50, 100, 150],
  interceptions: [20, 30, 40, 50]
}

async function detectMilestones(playerId, seasonStats) {
  // Check cumulative stats against thresholds
  // Insert milestone record when threshold crossed
}
```

### Phase 2: Single-Game Detection

```javascript
// In game-stats-scraper.js (after player stats inserted)

async function checkGameMilestones(playerGameStats) {
  if (playerGameStats.passing_yards >= 300) {
    await insertMilestone({
      player_id: playerGameStats.player_id,
      milestone_type: '300_yard_passing_game',
      milestone_value: playerGameStats.passing_yards,
      achieved_date: new Date(),
      game_id: playerGameStats.game_id
    })
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Awards Integration

Manual entry or API integration with NFL awards announcements.

## Why This Table Exists (But Isn't Used)

This table was created as **part of a comprehensive NFL database schema** to support advanced frontend features like:
- Player legacy/hall-of-fame tracking
- Historical significance markers
- Fan engagement ("milestone watch")
- Media content generation

However, **it's not critical** for core stats functionality and requires significant development effort to populate correctly.
