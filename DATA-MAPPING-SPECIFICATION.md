# DATA MAPPING SPECIFICATION

> **Purpose**: Define exactly what data we need from our database to display each page/view in the frontend.
> **Date**: October 22, 2025
> **Status**: Draft for Review

---

## Overview

This document maps our **backend data sources** ‚Üí **frontend display requirements**.

**Proven Capabilities** (from test-week4.js):
- ‚úÖ Week scoreboard with 16 games
- ‚úÖ Team rosters with 78+ players per team
- ‚úÖ Game-day rosters with stats
- ‚úÖ Player game statistics (passing, rushing, receiving, defense)
- ‚úÖ Team game statistics
- ‚úÖ Quarter-by-quarter scores
- ‚úÖ Scoring plays timeline

**What We Need to Define**:
1. Which pages/views do we want to build?
2. For each page, what exact data fields do we display?
3. Which database tables/scripts provide that data?
4. What's missing (if anything)?

## üìä Data Completeness Assessment

### What We Have (‚úÖ Confirmed Working)
| Data Type | Source | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Live scoreboard | get-live-scoreboard.js | ‚úÖ Working |
| Team rosters | get-team-roster.js | ‚úÖ Working |
| Game-day rosters | get-gameday-roster.js | ‚úÖ Working |
| Player game stats | player_game_stats table | ‚úÖ 6,842 records |
| Team game stats | team_game_stats table | ‚úÖ 212 records |
| Scoring plays | scoring_plays table | ‚úÖ 917 records |
| Quarter scores | games table | ‚úÖ Available |
| Season cumulative stats | player_season_cumulative_stats | ‚úÖ 1,516 players |

### What We Need to Build (‚ö†Ô∏è Scripts/Queries Needed)
| Feature | Missing Component | Effort |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| Team records (W-L) | Query games table, calculate | 1 hour |
| Standings with streak | Calculate from games | 1 hour |
| Leaderboard queries | Rank player_season_cumulative_stats | 2 hours |
| Player profile script | Aggregate player data | 2 hours |
| Schedule by week script | Query + format games | 1 hour |

### What's Incomplete (‚ùå Data Gaps)
| Feature | Issue | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Injury reports | Table exists but may be empty | Run injuries-scraper.js |
| Team records/standings | No standings table? | Verify schema or calculate from games |
| Player headshots | URLs exist in players table | Already have this! |
| Weather humidity | Only have temp/wind/conditions | ESPN may not provide % |
| Draft info | Not in schema | Add to players table (future) |

---

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Phase 1: Verify What We Have (1-2 hours)
1. Check if standings data exists in database
2. Verify injury_status table has data
3. Confirm player headshot URLs are valid

### Phase 2: Build Missing Query Scripts (6-8 hours)
1. **get-team-record.js** - Calculate team W-L from games
2. **get-leaderboard.js** - Rank players by stat category
3. **get-player-profile.js** - Aggregate player data
4. **get-schedule.js** - Format season schedule by week
5. **get-standings.js** - Calculate/format standings with streaks

### Phase 3: Data Validation (2-3 hours)
1. Run all scripts and verify output matches requirements
2. Check for missing/null fields
3. Test with different weeks/teams/players

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration (Separate effort)
1. Create TypeScript interfaces matching these data structures
2. Build API endpoints or static data generation
3. Connect Next.js components to data

---

## üîç Questions to Answer

Before we proceed, we should decide:

1. **Which pages are priority?**
   - Home (scoreboard) - YES
   - Game details - YES
   - Team page - YES
   - Player page - ?
   - Standings - ?
   - Leaderboards - ?

2. **Real-time vs Static?**
   - Do we need live score updates during games?
   - Or is "refresh page" acceptable?

3. **Mobile-first?**
   - What's our primary target device?

4. **Performance constraints?**
   - How many API calls per page load is acceptable?
   - Should we pre-generate static pages?

---

## üìù Summary

**We have proven**:
- ‚úÖ Scoreboard works (16 games with live scores)
- ‚úÖ Rosters work (78+ players per team)
- ‚úÖ Game stats work (team + player stats + scoring plays)
- ‚úÖ Data is comprehensive (6,842+ player game stats)

**We need to build**:
- Query scripts for team records, leaderboards, player profiles
- Calculate derived data (W-L records, rankings, streaks)
- Verify/populate injury data

**We're ready to**:
- Define final page list (prioritize)
- Build missing query scripts
- Start frontend integration

---

**Decision Point**: Should we build all the missing query scripts now, or prioritize specific pages first?
