## Recommended Sources We DON'T Use (Gap Analysis)

### High Priority - Should Add ⭐

#### 1. **SportsOddsHistory.com** - Historical Betting Lines
- **Why we need it:**
  - Historical odds data (1958–present) for greatest games algorithm
  - Validates "upset" factor for historical games
  - Completes betting context for games before 2025
- **Use case:** Backfill historical spread data for greatest games calculation
- **Cost:** Unknown (need to investigate)
- **Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH - Critical for historical greatest games ranking

#### 2. **NFL's 100 Greatest Games List** - Validation Dataset
- **Why we need it:**
  - Benchmark our algorithm against NFL's official rankings
  - Validate "Legendary" tier accuracy
  - Curated list for algorithm training/tuning
- **Use case:** Validation and weight tuning for greatness score
- **Cost:** FREE (official NFL content)
- **Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ HIGH - Essential for algorithm validation

#### 3. **nfelo App / Neil Paine's Elo Ratings** - Team Strength Context
- **Why we need it:**
  - Historical Elo ratings add context to upsets
  - Better than simple spread for "underdog story" weight
  - Can calculate "strength of opponent" multiplier
- **Use case:** Enhanced stakes multiplier based on team strength differential
- **Cost:** FREE (public data)
- **Priority:** ⭐⭐ MEDIUM - Improves algorithm accuracy

### Medium Priority - Nice to Have

#### 4. **FiveThirtyEight NFL Fandom Dataset** - Fan Engagement
- **Why we could use it:**
  - Add "cultural impact" weight based on fan base size
  - Viewership proxy (larger fanbases = more eyeballs)
  - Regional significance multiplier
- **Use case:** Contextual factor for "most watched" games
- **Cost:** FREE (Kaggle dataset)
- **Priority:** ⭐ LOW - Interesting but not essential

#### 5. **Twitter Sentiment / Action Network Moodiest Fans** - Cultural Impact
- **Why we could use it:**
  - Real-time sentiment analysis
  - Measure "buzz" and cultural resonance
  - Validate narrative significance
- **Use case:** Future enhancement - AI-powered cultural impact scoring
- **Cost:** Varies (Twitter API has costs)
- **Priority:** ⭐ LOW - Future feature, not MVP

### Low Priority - Already Covered or Paid

#### 6. **SportsDataIO / Sportradar / Genius Sports** - Professional APIs
- **Why we DON'T need them:**
  - ESPN API + nflverse covers 95%+ of our needs
  - These are PAID APIs (expensive for side projects)
  - No unique data we can't get elsewhere
- **Coverage:** ❌ NOT NEEDED - Free sources are sufficient
- **Cost:** $$$$ (Professional tier pricing)

#### 7. **Kaggle Datasets** - Supplementary Data
- **Why we DON'T need them:**
  - Most Kaggle NFL data is derived from ESPN or nflverse
  - We're already pulling from primary sources
  - Kaggle datasets go stale (not live)
- **Coverage:** ❌ NOT NEEDED - We have live data pipelines
- **Use case:** Could be useful for one-time historical analysis
