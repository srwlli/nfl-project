## Testing & Validation

### Required Testing Steps:

1. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   # Apply to Supabase
   # Migrations: 20250101000020, 20250101000021
   ```

2. **Test enhanced scraper on single game:**
   ```bash
   npm run scrape:game-stats -- --game=401772510
   # Verify 45 fields populate (40 ESPN + 5 fantasy)
   ```

3. **Backfill 76 missing games:**
   ```bash
   npm run scrape:game-stats -- --week=2
   npm run scrape:game-stats -- --week=3
   # ... weeks 2-7
   ```

4. **Run weekly aggregation:**
   ```bash
   npm run aggregate:weekly -- --week=7
   # Verify weekly leaders + season cumulative populate
   ```

5. **Validate data completeness:**
   ```sql
   -- Check player stats have new fields
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_game_stats WHERE fantasy_points_ppr IS NOT NULL;

   -- Check weekly leaders populated
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM weekly_stat_leaders WHERE season=2025 AND week=7;

   -- Check season cumulative populated
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player_season_cumulative_stats WHERE season=2025;
   ```

## Known Limitations & TODOs

### ESPN Boxscore Limitations:
- ‚ùå **Passing longest:** Not in summary API (need play-by-play)
- ‚ùå **YAC (Yards After Catch):** Requires Next Gen Stats (Phase 3)
- ‚ùå **Snap counts:** Requires separate source (Phase 2)
- ‚ùå **Routes run:** Requires separate source (Phase 2)

### Pending Phase 1 Items:
- [ ] **trending-analytics-calculator.js** - Hot/cold streaks, breakout detection
- [ ] **advanced-analytics-scraper.js enhancement** - Per-player EPA from nflverse
- [ ] **Backfill 76 missing games** - Weeks 2-7 (81% of completed games)
- [ ] **Re-scrape all 94 games** - To populate new fields

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Phase 1 Completion):
1. **Apply database migrations** to Supabase
2. **Test enhanced scraper** on 1 recent game
3. **Backfill 76 missing games** (Weeks 2-7)
4. **Run weekly aggregation** for Week 7
5. **Validate all 303 fields** populate correctly

### Phase 2 (Betting & Opportunity):
1. Enhance betting-scraper.js for player props
2. Create snap-counts-scraper.js
3. Add to scheduler

### Phase 3 (DFS & Next Gen):
1. Create dfs-scraper.js (DraftKings/FanDuel salaries)
2. Create next-gen-stats-scraper.js (NFL.com)

### Phase 4 (Trending):
1. Create trending-analytics-calculator.js
2. Populate player_trending_analytics table

---

## Performance Estimates

### Scraper Performance:
- **game-stats-scraper (enhanced):** ~1200ms per game (was 800ms)
- **weekly-aggregation:** ~15-20 seconds per week
- **Backfill 76 games:** ~90 seconds total (parallel execution possible)

### Database Impact:
- **player_game_stats:** +44 columns (minimal storage impact)
- **New tables:** ~12,000 records/season (weekly + cumulative + trending)
