## üìù Notes for NextJS Team

### Already Researched, Not Implemented
All 15 APIs above were researched but NOT integrated into the current Python backend. Documentation exists in:
- `context/perplexity-api-list.md`
- `context/perplexity-player-news-apis.md`
- `context/cursor-api-research-summary.md`

### Why Not Implemented?
1. **Cost:** Most premium APIs require enterprise pricing
2. **Redundancy:** Free sources (nflreadpy) cover 85% of needs
3. **Complexity:** Additional APIs increase maintenance burden
4. **Focus:** Project prioritized 2025 season data over advanced features

### Recommended Strategy
**Phase 1:** Use current free APIs (nflreadpy, nflscraPy, ESPN, sportsref-nfl)
**Phase 2:** Add The Odds API ($99/mo) for live odds
**Phase 3:** Investigate Sports Insights and TeamRankings (free/low-cost)
**Phase 4:** Evaluate premium APIs if scaling to production betting service
