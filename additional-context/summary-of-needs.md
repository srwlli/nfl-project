 High Priority (Critical for functionality):
  1. Design System/Brand Guidelines - Colors, typography, spacing, components
  2. Navigation Architecture - Site structure, menus, breadcrumbs, discovery
  3. Search & Filter Interface - Global search, advanced filters, autocomplete
  4. Data Tables Standard - Comprehensive table design (we touched on it, but needs full spec)
  5. Real-time Updates & Notifications - Live score updates, breaking news, alerts
  6. Error/Empty States - 404s, loading states, no data messages, error handling

  Medium Priority (Important for UX):
  7. Comparison Tools - Compare players, teams, eras side-by-side
  8. Form Design - Betting slips, player search, advanced queries, filters
  9. Mobile Navigation - Mobile-specific patterns, hamburger menus, touch interactions
  10. Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG compliance, keyboard nav, screen reader support
  11. Animations & Transitions - Hover states, page transitions, timing, easing

  Lower Priority (Nice-to-have):
  12. Betting Integration - Display odds, spreads, lines (if including betting)
  13. User Preferences - Dark mode, layout options, data density settings
  14. Performance Standards - Load times, optimization targets, lazy loading
  15. Video Player Interface - If showing game highlights/video

  My Recommendation for Next 3:

  #1: Design System/Brand Guidelines
  - Color palette (team colors, status colors, semantic colors)
  - Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line heights)
  - Spacing system (margins, padding, gaps)
  - Component library (buttons, badges, chips, modals)
  - Icons (position icons, stat icons, action icons)

  #2: Navigation Architecture
  - Site map / information hierarchy
  - Main navigation structure
  - Breadcrumb system
  - Footer structure
  - Mobile menu patterns

  #3: Search & Filter Interface
  - Global search (autocomplete, fuzzy matching)
  - Advanced filters (by position, team, era, stat ranges)
  - Saved searches
  - Search results page design
