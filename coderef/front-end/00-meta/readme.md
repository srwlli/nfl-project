## ⚡ Next Critical Task

### **CREATE DESIGN SYSTEM & BRAND GUIDELINES**

This is **BLOCKING** all component development.

Should include:
- Color palette (team colors, semantic, status)
- Typography (fonts, sizes, weights, line heights)
- Spacing system (margins, padding, gaps)
- Component library (buttons, badges, chips, modals)
- Icons (position, stat, action icons)
- Responsive breakpoints
- Accessibility standards
- Dark mode (if applicable)
- Animations and transitions

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

---

**Frontend Status**: 69% Complete (Specs 100%, Design System Pending, Implementation 0%)
**Backend Status**: 100% Complete (Ready for Frontend)
**Overall Project**: Specs + Backend = 100% | Development = Ready to Start

**Questions?** Reference specific spec file or check INDEX.md for details.
