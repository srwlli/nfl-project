## User Engagement Value

**Why this component is valuable**:

1. **Daily Engagement**: Users check every day for "what happened today"
2. **Discovery**: Learn NFL history they didn't know
3. **Nostalgia**: Remember great games/players from the past
4. **Shareable**: Great content to share on social ("Remember when...")
5. **SEO**: Every date has unique content (365 pages of history)
6. **Mobile App**: Perfect for daily notification: "On This Day in 1985..."

**Example engagement loop**:
- User visits Oct 16 page
- Sees Patrick Mahomes' epic 2019 game
- Clicks to watch highlights
- Discovers related Mahomes games
- Browses other historic games
- Comes back tomorrow for Oct 17

## Historical Data Required

Your database needs to track:
- All NFL games since 1920 (date + result)
- Player birth dates
- Hall of Fame induction dates
- Record-setting performances (with dates)
- Major transactions (with dates)
- Player death dates
- Career milestones and anniversaries

**All of this data should already exist in your backend** since you have historical NFL data from 1970-2024.
