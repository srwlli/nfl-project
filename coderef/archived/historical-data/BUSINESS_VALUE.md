## Strategic Positioning

### Current State (2025-Only)
- Focused: Current season data only
- Commodity: Same as ESPN, Yahoo, official NFL site

- Powerful: Can answer any NFL question since 1970
- Audience: Researchers, analysts, serious bettors, academics

## Competitive Differentiation

### What Competitors Offer
- **ESPN**: Current season + shallow historical (last 5 years)
- **Yahoo Sports**: Current season + basic history
- **NFL.com**: Current season official data only
- **Specialized Sites**: Deep historical but NOT integrated with current

**Your Advantage**: Current season + 55-year integrated archive

### Market Gap We Fill
```
Current Market:
├── Real-time Sites (ESPN, Yahoo) → Shallow history
├── Historical Archives (PFR, others) → No current data
└── [GAP] Integrated Current + Historical

We Occupy This Gap
