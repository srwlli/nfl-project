## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
**Indexes:**

- ‚úÖ Index on `team_id` for team-based queries
- ‚úÖ Composite index on `(player_id, season)` for player season lookups
- ‚úÖ Index on `position` for position-based filtering
- ‚úÖ Index on `game_id` for game-based queries
- ‚úÖ Full-text index on `player_name` for search

**Table Partitioning:**
- ‚úÖ Partition `player_season_stats` by decade (1970s, 1980s, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Partition `play_by_play` by season
- ‚úÖ Partition `game_logs` by season

---

### Caching Strategy

- ‚úÖ Cache award winner pages

---

### Aggregation Pipelines
**Pre-calculated Aggregates:**
- ‚úÖ Pre-calculate season totals from game logs (nightly during season)
- ‚úÖ Pre-calculate career totals from season totals (weekly)
- ‚úÖ Pre-calculate leaderboards (weekly)
- ‚úÖ Pre-calculate situational splits from play-by-play (weekly)
- ‚úÖ Pre-calculate team rankings and standings (nightly during season)
