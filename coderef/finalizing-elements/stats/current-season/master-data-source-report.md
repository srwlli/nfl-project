- **Client Subscriptions:** FastAPI WebSocket endpoint for client connections

### Database Updates
**Real-Time (Live Stats):**
- WebSocket → Redis cache (30s TTL) → PostgreSQL (batch writes every 30s)
- Instant reads from Redis, periodic persistence to PostgreSQL

**Weekly (Season Stats):**
- nflreadpy → PostgreSQL (batch updates Mon-Wed after games)
- No caching (data doesn't change frequently)

**Daily (Injury Reports):**
- ESPN API → PostgreSQL (updates 2x daily: morning, afternoon)
- Cache in Redis for 4 hours

### Caching Strategy
| Data Type | Cache | TTL | Storage | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----|---------|-------|
| Live Game Data | Redis | 30s | PostgreSQL (batch) | Instant reads, periodic writes |
| Weekly Stats | None | N/A | PostgreSQL | Updated Mon-Wed |
| Injury Reports | Redis | 4 hours | PostgreSQL | Updated 2x daily |
| Betting Odds | Redis | 1 minute | PostgreSQL | Real-time updates |
| DFS Salaries | Redis | 1 hour | PostgreSQL | Updated weekly |
| NGS Data | None | N/A | PostgreSQL | Updated weekly post-game |

### API Endpoints
**FastAPI Endpoints:**

  - **Consistency Scoring:** Boom/bust rates, volatility, ceiling/floor calculations
  - **Advanced Fantasy Metrics:** Yards per route, broken tackles, target quality
  - **Prop Hit Rate Tracker:** Historical prop performance, edge calculations

### Data Freshness
| Data Type | Update Frequency | Latency | Source |
|-----------|------------------|---------|--------|
| **Live Game Stats** | Instant (every play) | <30 seconds | WebSocket |
| **Weekly Leaderboards** | Weekly | Mon-Wed (day after games) | nflreadpy |
| **Season Cumulative** | Weekly | Mon-Wed (day after games) | nflreadpy |
| **Injury Reports** | Daily | 2x daily (morning, afternoon) | ESPN API |
| **Betting Odds** | Real-time | <1 minute | The Odds API |
| **DFS Salaries** | Weekly | Thursday (before games) | DFS APIs |

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items

#### 1. WebSocket Integration Complexity
- **Risk:** WebSocket implementation may be complex, unreliable, or expensive
- **Impact:** High (150 fields, P0 critical)
- **Mitigation:** Fallback polling strategy (30s), multiple provider options (ESPN, NFL.com)
- **Status:** Planned

#### 2. DFS API Access
- **Risk:** DFS APIs may not be publicly available, require scraping, or be expensive
- **Impact:** Medium (12 fields, P0 for fantasy features)
- **Mitigation:** Scraping infrastructure as fallback, partnership with DFS providers
- **Status:** Planned

#### 3. Analytics Engine Complexity
- **Risk:** Projection/trending algorithms may be complex, inaccurate, or time-consuming to build
- **Impact:** High (109 fields, P0/P1 mixed)
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple algorithms (pace-based projections), iterate based on accuracy
- **Status:** Planned

### Medium-Risk Items

#### 4. The Odds API Rate Limits
- **Risk:** Free tier (500 requests/month) may be insufficient for real-time updates
- **Impact:** Medium (58 fields, P1)
- **Mitigation:** Paid tier ($30/mo) available if needed, caching strategy to reduce requests
- **Status:** Planned

#### 5. NGS Scraping Reliability
- **Risk:** NFL.com may change structure, breaking scraper; NGS not available for all players
- **Impact:** Low (8 fields, P1)
- **Mitigation:** Unofficial API as fallback, data completeness checks
- **Status:** Planned

### Low-Risk Items

#### 6. Manual Entry System
- **Risk:** Manual curation may be time-consuming or inconsistent
- **Impact:** Low (10 fields, P1)
- **Mitigation:** Simple admin UI, clear curation guidelines
- **Status:** Planned

## Conclusion

The Current Season Stats system requires **674 total fields** across 10 sections, with **69.7% overall coverage** already mapped to data sources. The system is well-positioned for MVP implementation with:

✅ **Strong Foundation:**
- 72.1% free sources (nflreadpy, ESPN API, NGS, manual entry, calculated)
- 8.6% free-tier sources (The Odds API)
- Only 19.3% paid/planned sources (WebSocket, DFS APIs)

✅ **Clear Implementation Path:**
- 8 well-defined implementation tasks
- Critical integrations identified (WebSocket, analytics engine, DFS APIs)
- Technical architecture defined (hybrid WebSocket/polling, Redis caching, microservices)

✅ **Reasonable Cost:**
- MVP cost: $100-200/month (excludes P2 social features)
- Full cost: $200-300/month (includes P2 social features)

⚠️ **Key Challenges:**
- WebSocket integration (150 fields, high complexity)
- Analytics engine (109 fields, algorithmic complexity)
- DFS API access (12 fields, availability uncertain)

🎯 **Recommended MVP Focus:**
1. **Phase 1:** WebSocket + nflreadpy (470 fields, P0 core)
2. **Phase 2:** Analytics engine (109 fields, P0/P1 mixed)
3. **Phase 3:** DFS APIs + The Odds API (70 fields, P0/P1 mixed)
4. **Phase 4:** NGS + Manual Entry (18 fields, P1)
5. **Post-MVP:** Twitter API v2 (18 fields, P2 deferred)

**Status:** All 674 fields mapped to sources - Ready for systematic implementation.

**Document Status:** Complete - Comprehensive coverage analysis for all 674 current-season stats fields
**Next Steps:**
1. Prioritize WebSocket integration (150 fields, P0 critical)
2. Begin analytics engine design (109 fields, P0/P1 mixed)
3. Secure DFS API access or build scraping infrastructure (12 fields, P0)
4. Implement The Odds API integration (58 fields, P1)
5. Build NGS scraper (8 fields, P1)
