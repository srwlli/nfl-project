## Table Organization

The 41 tables are organized into **6 logical domains**:

### Domain 1: Core Entities (8 tables)

Foundation tables representing the primary entities in the NFL universe.

| Table | Purpose | Est. Rows | Key Relationships |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| `teams` | NFL franchises | 32 | → team_seasons, games, stats |
| `players` | All NFL players | 27,000 | → all player stats tables |
| `coaches` | Head coaches & coordinators | 800 | → team_seasons |
| `seasons` | NFL seasons (1970-2024) | 55 | → all season-level tables |
| `games` | All games (partitioned) | 14,000 | → game_stats, play_by_play |
| `stadiums` | NFL stadiums (historical) | 100 | → games, teams |
| `positions` | Position definitions | 25 | → players, stats |
| `team_seasons` | Team-season combinations | 1,760 | → team_season_stats |

**Design Notes:**
- `teams` table includes franchise history (relocations, name changes)
- `players` table is the central hub with foreign keys from all stats tables
- `games` table is partitioned by season for performance
- `stadiums` table tracks historical venues (many teams have moved)

### Domain 2: Player Stats (10 tables)

Comprehensive player statistics at multiple granularities.

| Table | Purpose | Est. Rows | Partitioned? |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| `player_season_stats` | Season-level aggregated stats | 145,000 | Yes (by decade) |
| `player_game_stats` | Game-level stats | 1,000,000 | Yes (by season) |
| `player_career_stats` | Career totals & aggregations | 27,000 | No |
| `player_passing_stats` | Detailed QB passing stats | 25,000 | No |
| `player_rushing_stats` | Detailed RB/QB rushing stats | 40,000 | No |
| `player_receiving_stats` | Detailed WR/TE receiving stats | 60,000 | No |
| `player_defensive_stats` | Defensive player stats | 35,000 | No |
| `player_kicking_stats` | K/P special teams stats | 8,000 | No |
| `player_returning_stats` | Return specialist stats | 12,000 | No |
| `player_advanced_stats` | Advanced analytics (EPA, etc.) | 18,000 | No |

**Design Notes:**
- Two-tier partitioning: `player_season_stats` by decade, `player_game_stats` by season
- Position-specific stats tables improve query performance
- `player_career_stats` denormalized for fast career queries
- Advanced stats available from 2000+ (limited historical data)

### Domain 3: Team Stats (5 tables)

Team-level statistics and performance metrics.

| Table | Purpose | Est. Rows | Key Metrics |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `team_season_stats` | Season-level team stats | 1,760 | Wins, losses, points, yards |
| `team_game_stats` | Game-level team stats | 28,000 | Per-game team performance |
| `team_offense_stats` | Offensive stats by season | 1,760 | Pass/rush yards, TDs, efficiency |
| `team_defense_stats` | Defensive stats by season | 1,760 | Yards allowed, sacks, turnovers |
| `team_special_teams_stats` | Special teams by season | 1,760 | FG%, punt avg, return yards |

**Design Notes:**
- `team_season_stats` is the primary aggregation table
- Offense/defense/special teams broken out for detailed analysis
- Foreign keys to `team_seasons` for historical team tracking
- Includes advanced metrics (DVOA, EPA) where available

### Domain 4: Game Details (7 tables)

Granular game-level data including play-by-play.

| Table | Purpose | Est. Rows | Granularity |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `game_stats` | Game summary stats | 14,000 | Per game |
| `game_drives` | Drive-by-drive breakdown | 280,000 | Per drive (~20/game) |
| `play_by_play` | Every play (partitioned) | 7,000,000 | Per play (~130/game) |
| `scoring_plays` | All scoring plays | 70,000 | Per score (~5/game) |
| `key_plays` | Highlight plays | 140,000 | Per key play (~10/game) |
| `game_weather` | Weather conditions | 14,000 | Per game |
| `game_officials` | Officiating crews | 14,000 | Per game |

**Design Notes:**
- `play_by_play` is the largest table (~7M rows) - partitioned by season
- Supports real-time updates during live games
- `key_plays` extracted via ML/rules for highlight generation
- Weather data impacts analysis (home-field advantage, performance)

### Domain 5: Leaderboards (4 tables)

Pre-computed rankings and leaderboards for performance.

| Table | Purpose | Est. Rows | Refresh Frequency |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| `season_leaderboards` | Season stat leaders | 55,000 | Daily in season, weekly offseason |
| `career_leaderboards` | All-time career leaders | 10,000 | Weekly |
| `active_leaderboards` | Active player rankings | 2,000 | Daily |
| `rookie_leaderboards` | Rookie season rankings | 500 | Daily in season |

**Design Notes:**
- These could be materialized views, but tables for flexibility
- Enables fast leaderboard queries without expensive aggregations
- Includes multiple stat categories per table (passing yards, TDs, etc.)
- Historical context preserved (e.g., "led league in 2007")

### Domain 6: Reference & Relationships (7 tables)

Supporting data for player profiles and context.

| Table | Purpose | Est. Rows | Examples |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| `player_teams` | Player-team history | 35,000 | Tom Brady → Patriots, Buccaneers |
| `player_awards` | Awards won by players | 5,000 | MVP, Pro Bowl, All-Pro |
| `player_milestones` | Career milestones | 2,000 | 400 TD passes, 10,000 rush yards |
| `player_injuries` | Injury history | 8,000 | ACL tear, concussion, etc. |
| `player_contracts` | Contract details | 10,000 | $50M/5yr extension |
| `roster_transactions` | Signings, trades, releases | 50,000 | Signed, released, traded |
| `award_types` | Award definitions | 50 | MVP, DPOY, OROY, etc. |

**Design Notes:**
- `player_teams` enables "what teams did player X play for?"
- `player_awards` links to `award_types` for consistency
- `player_milestones` automatically detected via triggers
- Contracts/injuries optional (nice-to-have, not critical)

---

## Partitioning Strategy

### Tables with Partitioning

#### 1. `player_season_stats` (Partitioned by Decade)

**Rationale:** 145,000 rows spread across 55 years. Decade partitioning balances partition count with query performance.

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_season_stats (
    player_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    -- ... other columns
) PARTITION BY RANGE (season);

-- Create partitions
CREATE TABLE player_season_stats_1970s PARTITION OF player_season_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (1970) TO (1980);
CREATE TABLE player_season_stats_1980s PARTITION OF player_season_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (1980) TO (1990);
CREATE TABLE player_season_stats_1990s PARTITION OF player_season_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (1990) TO (2000);
CREATE TABLE player_season_stats_2000s PARTITION OF player_season_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2000) TO (2010);
CREATE TABLE player_season_stats_2010s PARTITION OF player_season_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2010) TO (2020);
CREATE TABLE player_season_stats_2020s PARTITION OF player_season_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2020) TO (2030);
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Queries filtering by season only scan relevant partition
- Maintenance operations (VACUUM, REINDEX) can target specific partitions
- Estimated 40-60% query speedup for single-season queries

#### 2. `player_game_stats` (Partitioned by Season - Recent Years Only)

**Rationale:** 1,000,000+ rows. Recent seasons queried more frequently, warrant individual partitions.

```sql
CREATE TABLE player_game_stats (
    player_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    game_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    -- ... other columns
) PARTITION BY RANGE (season);

-- Historical data (pre-2020) in one partition
CREATE TABLE player_game_stats_pre2020 PARTITION OF player_game_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (1970) TO (2020);

-- Recent seasons get individual partitions
CREATE TABLE player_game_stats_2020 PARTITION OF player_game_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2020) TO (2021);
CREATE TABLE player_game_stats_2021 PARTITION OF player_game_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2021) TO (2022);
CREATE TABLE player_game_stats_2022 PARTITION OF player_game_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2022) TO (2023);
CREATE TABLE player_game_stats_2023 PARTITION OF player_game_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2023) TO (2024);
CREATE TABLE player_game_stats_2024 PARTITION OF player_game_stats
    FOR VALUES FROM (2024) TO (2025);
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Current season queries 70-80% faster
- Easy to archive old partitions to cold storage
- Simplified maintenance for active partitions

#### 3. `play_by_play` (Partitioned by Season)

**Rationale:** Largest table (~7M rows). Historical play-by-play rarely queried, recent seasons very active.

```sql
CREATE TABLE play_by_play (
    play_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    game_id VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    -- ... other columns
) PARTITION BY RANGE (season);

-- Historical data combined
CREATE TABLE play_by_play_historical PARTITION OF play_by_play
    FOR VALUES FROM (1970) TO (2020);

-- Recent seasons individual partitions
CREATE TABLE play_by_play_2020 PARTITION OF play_by_play
    FOR VALUES FROM (2020) TO (2021);
-- ... (2021-2024 similar)
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Queries on current season 80-90% faster
- Dramatically reduced index size for active partitions
- Easier to manage 7M row table via partitioning

#### 4. `games` (Partitioned by Season)

**Rationale:** 14,000 rows. Partitioning less critical but helps organization.

```sql
CREATE TABLE games (
    game_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    season INTEGER NOT NULL,
    -- ... other columns
) PARTITION BY RANGE (season);

-- Can create per-season partitions or group by decade
-- Example: Individual seasons
CREATE TABLE games_2024 PARTITION OF games
    FOR VALUES FROM (2024) TO (2025);
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Moderate query speedup (20-30%)
- Primarily organizational benefit

---

## Indexing Strategy

### Index Categories

#### 1. Primary Key Indexes (Automatic)

Every table has a primary key with automatic index:
- `players(player_id)`
- `teams(team_id)`
- `games(game_id)`
- `player_season_stats(player_id, season)`
- etc.

#### 2. Foreign Key Indexes (Critical)

All foreign key columns indexed for join performance:

```sql
-- Players table foreign keys
CREATE INDEX idx_players_primary_position ON players(primary_position);

-- Player stats foreign keys
CREATE INDEX idx_player_season_stats_player ON player_season_stats(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_season_stats_team ON player_season_stats(team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_game_stats_player ON player_game_stats(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_game_stats_game ON player_game_stats(game_id);

-- Game foreign keys
CREATE INDEX idx_games_home_team ON games(home_team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_games_away_team ON games(away_team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_games_season ON games(season);
```

#### 3. Common Filter Indexes (Important)

Columns frequently used in WHERE clauses:

```sql
-- Season filters (very common)
CREATE INDEX idx_player_season_stats_season ON player_season_stats(season);
CREATE INDEX idx_team_season_stats_season ON team_season_stats(season);

-- Position filters (for leaderboards)
CREATE INDEX idx_player_season_stats_position ON player_season_stats(primary_position);

-- Status filters
CREATE INDEX idx_players_status ON players(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_games_status ON games(status);

-- Name searches (using pg_trgm for fuzzy search)
CREATE INDEX idx_players_last_name_trgm ON players USING gin(last_name gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_teams_name_trgm ON teams USING gin(team_name gin_trgm_ops);
```

#### 4. Composite Indexes (Performance-Critical)

Multi-column indexes for common query patterns:

```sql
-- Player season lookup (most common query)
CREATE INDEX idx_player_season_lookup ON player_season_stats(player_id, season);

-- Team season lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_team_season_lookup ON team_season_stats(team_id, season);

-- Position leaderboards by season
CREATE INDEX idx_season_position_leaders ON player_season_stats(season, primary_position, passing_yards DESC);

-- Game date range queries
CREATE INDEX idx_games_date_range ON games(game_date, season);

-- Player game stats lookup
CREATE INDEX idx_player_game_lookup ON player_game_stats(player_id, game_id, season);
```

#### 5. Sorting Indexes (Leaderboard Queries)

Indexes optimized for ORDER BY clauses:

```sql
-- Passing yards leaderboard
CREATE INDEX idx_passing_yards_leaders ON player_passing_stats(passing_yards DESC);

-- Rushing yards leaderboard
CREATE INDEX idx_rushing_yards_leaders ON player_rushing_stats(rushing_yards DESC);

-- Career stats sorting
CREATE INDEX idx_career_passing_yards ON player_career_stats(career_passing_yards DESC);

-- Team wins by season
CREATE INDEX idx_team_wins ON team_season_stats(season, wins DESC);
```

### Index Maintenance

```sql
-- Monitor index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;

-- Remove unused indexes
-- DROP INDEX idx_name; (only if idx_scan = 0 after monitoring period)

-- Rebuild indexes (monthly for heavily updated tables)
REINDEX TABLE player_game_stats;
```

**Total Estimated Indexes:** ~150 indexes across all tables

---

## Materialized Views

Pre-computed aggregations for expensive queries.

### 1. `mv_player_career_totals`

**Purpose:** Career totals for all players (eliminates need to SUM across seasons)

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_player_career_totals AS
SELECT
    p.player_id,
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name,
    p.primary_position,
    SUM(pss.games_played) AS career_games,
    SUM(pss.passing_yards) AS career_passing_yards,
    SUM(pss.passing_touchdowns) AS career_passing_tds,
    SUM(pss.rushing_yards) AS career_rushing_yards,
    SUM(pss.receiving_yards) AS career_receiving_yards,
    -- ... all other stats
    MIN(pss.season) AS first_season,
    MAX(pss.season) AS last_season
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN player_season_stats pss ON p.player_id = pss.player_id
GROUP BY p.player_id, p.first_name, p.last_name, p.primary_position;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_mv_career_player ON mv_player_career_totals(player_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_career_passing_yards ON mv_player_career_totals(career_passing_yards DESC);
```

**Refresh Strategy:** Daily during season, weekly in offseason
**Estimated Speedup:** 50-100x for career stat queries

### 2. `mv_season_stat_leaders`

**Purpose:** Top 10 leaders in each stat category by season

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_season_stat_leaders AS
SELECT
    season,
    'passing_yards' AS stat_category,
    player_id,
    passing_yards AS stat_value,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY season ORDER BY passing_yards DESC) AS rank
FROM player_season_stats
WHERE passing_attempts >= 100 -- qualification threshold
UNION ALL
SELECT season, 'rushing_yards', player_id, rushing_yards,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY season ORDER BY rushing_yards DESC)
FROM player_season_stats
WHERE rushing_attempts >= 50
-- ... repeat for all stat categories
ORDER BY season DESC, stat_category, rank;

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_leaders_season ON mv_season_stat_leaders(season, stat_category, rank);
```

**Refresh Strategy:** Hourly during game days, daily otherwise
**Estimated Speedup:** 20-30x for leaderboard queries

### 3. `mv_team_season_rankings`

**Purpose:** Team rankings by season across multiple metrics

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_team_season_rankings AS
SELECT
    tss.team_id,
    tss.season,
    tss.wins,
    tss.losses,
    tss.points_for,
    tss.points_against,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tss.season ORDER BY tss.wins DESC, tss.points_for DESC) AS standing,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tss.season ORDER BY tos.total_yards DESC) AS offense_rank,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY tss.season ORDER BY tds.total_yards_allowed ASC) AS defense_rank
FROM team_season_stats tss
LEFT JOIN team_offense_stats tos ON tss.team_id = tos.team_id AND tss.season = tos.season
LEFT JOIN team_defense_stats tds ON tss.team_id = tds.team_id AND tss.season = tds.season
ORDER BY season DESC, standing;

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_team_rankings_season ON mv_team_season_rankings(season, standing);
```

**Refresh Strategy:** Daily during season
**Estimated Speedup:** 10-15x for team rankings queries

### 4. `mv_active_player_rankings`

**Purpose:** Current rankings for active players only

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_active_player_rankings AS
SELECT
    pct.player_id,
    pct.first_name,
    pct.last_name,
    pct.primary_position,
    pct.career_passing_yards,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY pct.primary_position ORDER BY pct.career_passing_yards DESC) AS passing_rank,
    pct.career_rushing_yards,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY pct.primary_position ORDER BY pct.career_rushing_yards DESC) AS rushing_rank
    -- ... other rankings
FROM mv_player_career_totals pct
JOIN players p ON pct.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE p.status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_active_position ON mv_active_player_rankings(primary_position, passing_rank);
```

**Refresh Strategy:** Daily
**Estimated Speedup:** 30-40x for active player queries

### 5. `mv_hof_eligible_players`

**Purpose:** Hall of Fame eligible players with career stats

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_hof_eligible_players AS
SELECT
    pct.*,
    CASE
        WHEN pct.last_season <= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 5 THEN TRUE
        ELSE FALSE
    END AS is_eligible,
    pa.award_count
FROM mv_player_career_totals pct
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT player_id, COUNT(*) AS award_count
    FROM player_awards
    WHERE award_type IN ('MVP', 'All-Pro 1st Team', 'Pro Bowl')
    GROUP BY player_id
) pa ON pct.player_id = pa.player_id
WHERE pct.last_season <= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 5
ORDER BY pct.primary_position, pct.career_passing_yards DESC;

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_hof_position ON mv_hof_eligible_players(primary_position, is_eligible);
```

**Refresh Strategy:** Weekly
**Estimated Speedup:** 15-20x for HOF candidate queries

### 6. `mv_rookie_season_performance`

**Purpose:** Rookie season stats for all players

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_rookie_season_performance AS
SELECT
    pss.*,
    p.draft_year,
    p.draft_round,
    p.draft_pick
FROM player_season_stats pss
JOIN players p ON pss.player_id = p.player_id
WHERE pss.season = p.draft_year
ORDER BY pss.season DESC, pss.passing_yards DESC;

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_rookie_season ON mv_rookie_season_performance(season, primary_position);
```

**Refresh Strategy:** Daily during season, weekly in offseason
**Estimated Speedup:** 20-25x for rookie comparison queries

### Materialized View Refresh Commands

```sql
-- Concurrent refresh (non-blocking)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_player_career_totals;

-- Full refresh (requires exclusive lock)
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_season_stat_leaders;

-- Automated refresh via cron job or scheduler
-- Example: Daily at 3 AM UTC
SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-career-totals', '0 3 * * *',
    'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_player_career_totals');
```

---

## Data Integrity & Constraints

### Foreign Key Constraints

All relationships enforced via foreign keys:

```sql
-- Player stats → Players
ALTER TABLE player_season_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_player_season_stats_player
    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Player stats → Teams
ALTER TABLE player_season_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_player_season_stats_team
    FOREIGN KEY (team_id) REFERENCES teams(team_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT;

-- Games → Teams
ALTER TABLE games
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_games_home_team
    FOREIGN KEY (home_team_id) REFERENCES teams(team_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT;

ALTER TABLE games
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_games_away_team
    FOREIGN KEY (away_team_id) REFERENCES teams(team_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT;

-- Play-by-play → Games
ALTER TABLE play_by_play
    ADD CONSTRAINT fk_play_by_play_game
    FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES games(game_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

**Delete Policies:**
- `CASCADE`: Child records deleted when parent deleted (stats deleted when player deleted)
- `RESTRICT`: Prevent deletion if child records exist (can't delete team if games reference it)
- `SET NULL`: Set foreign key to NULL (rarely used in this schema)

### Check Constraints

Data validation at database level:

```sql
-- Season range validation
ALTER TABLE player_season_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT chk_season_range
    CHECK (season >= 1970 AND season <= 2030);

-- Positive stats validation
ALTER TABLE player_season_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT chk_positive_games
    CHECK (games_played >= 0);

ALTER TABLE player_passing_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT chk_positive_attempts
    CHECK (passing_attempts >= 0 AND completions >= 0 AND completions <= passing_attempts);

-- Win/loss total validation
ALTER TABLE team_season_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT chk_wins_losses
    CHECK (wins + losses + ties = games_played);

-- Game score validation
ALTER TABLE games
    ADD CONSTRAINT chk_positive_scores
    CHECK (home_score >= 0 AND away_score >= 0);

-- Date validation
ALTER TABLE games
    ADD CONSTRAINT chk_game_date_range
    CHECK (game_date >= '1970-01-01' AND game_date <= CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 year');
```

### NOT NULL Constraints

Critical columns enforced as NOT NULL:

```sql
-- Players table
ALTER TABLE players
    ALTER COLUMN first_name SET NOT NULL,
    ALTER COLUMN last_name SET NOT NULL,
    ALTER COLUMN primary_position SET NOT NULL;

-- Games table
ALTER TABLE games
    ALTER COLUMN game_date SET NOT NULL,
    ALTER COLUMN home_team_id SET NOT NULL,
    ALTER COLUMN away_team_id SET NOT NULL,
    ALTER COLUMN season SET NOT NULL;

-- Stats tables
ALTER TABLE player_season_stats
    ALTER COLUMN player_id SET NOT NULL,
    ALTER COLUMN season SET NOT NULL,
    ALTER COLUMN team_id SET NOT NULL;
```

### Unique Constraints

Prevent duplicate records:

```sql
-- Player season stats (one record per player per season per team)
ALTER TABLE player_season_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT uq_player_season_team
    UNIQUE (player_id, season, team_id);

-- Player game stats (one record per player per game)
ALTER TABLE player_game_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT uq_player_game
    UNIQUE (player_id, game_id);

-- Team season stats (one record per team per season)
ALTER TABLE team_season_stats
    ADD CONSTRAINT uq_team_season
    UNIQUE (team_id, season);

-- Games (prevent duplicate game records)
ALTER TABLE games
    ADD CONSTRAINT uq_game_matchup
    UNIQUE (home_team_id, away_team_id, game_date);
```

### Audit Trail

All tables include audit columns:

```sql
-- Standard audit columns
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
deleted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL  -- Soft delete support
```

**Soft Delete Pattern:**
- Never physically delete records (preserves historical data)
- Set `deleted_at` timestamp when "deleting"
- Queries filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` for active records
- Enables data recovery and audit trails

1. **Partitioning**: 4 largest tables partitioned (40-80% speedup)
2. **Indexing**: ~150 indexes on critical columns (10-100x speedup)
3. **Materialized Views**: 6 views for expensive aggregations (20-100x speedup)
4. **Denormalization**: Career stats table for fast career queries
5. **Connection Pooling**: Recommended (pgBouncer or application-level)
6. **Query Caching**: Application-level Redis cache (1-24 hour TTLs)

### Database Configuration Recommendations

```ini
# postgresql.conf optimization for 8 GB RAM server

# Memory settings
shared_buffers = 2GB              # 25% of RAM
effective_cache_size = 6GB        # 75% of RAM
work_mem = 32MB                   # Per-query sort/hash memory
maintenance_work_mem = 512MB      # For VACUUM, CREATE INDEX

# Query planning
random_page_cost = 1.1            # SSDs have lower random access cost
effective_io_concurrency = 200    # For SSDs

# Write performance
wal_buffers = 16MB
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
max_wal_size = 2GB
min_wal_size = 1GB

# Parallelization
max_worker_processes = 4
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 2
max_parallel_workers = 4

# Logging
log_min_duration_statement = 500  # Log queries >500ms
log_statement = 'ddl'             # Log schema changes
```
