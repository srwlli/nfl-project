## Caching Strategy

### Long TTL (Season Data)
- Team identity: 1 week (rarely changes)
- Franchise history: 1 month (static)
- All-time leaders: 1 day (rare changes)
- Coaching staff: 1 week (rare changes)
- Stadium info: 1 month (static)

- Roster: 6 hours (daily changes possible)
- Schedule: 1 hour (odds updates)
- Standings: 1 hour (after games)
- Key players: 1 hour (after games)

### Short TTL (Real-Time)

## Progressive Enhancement

### Initial Load (< 1 second)
1. Team header (logo, name, record, standings)
2. Current season overview
3. Next game info

### Secondary Load (1-2 seconds)
4. Roster table (active roster only)
5. Basic team stats (PPG, YPG, rank)
6. Schedule (current week context)
7. Division standings

### Tertiary Load (2-3 seconds)
8. Full statistics (all tabs)
9. Complete schedule
10. News feed
11. Key players spotlight

### On-Demand Load
12. Practice squad and IR (expand roster)
13. Coaching staff (separate tab)
14. Franchise history (separate tab)
15. All-time leaders (separate tab)
16. Advanced analytics (separate tab)
17. Historical schedules (season dropdown)

---

## Mobile Considerations

### Priority on Small Screens
- **Above fold:** Team header, current record, next game
- **Tabs:** Overview | Roster | Schedule | Stats | News
- **Collapsed sections:** Coaching staff, history, analytics
- **On-demand:** Full roster (show starters only initially)

### Data Usage Optimization
- Lazy load roster photos
- Load stats tabs on demand
- Don't load historical data until requested
- Compress team logos and photos

---

## Integrations (Modular)

### Player Profiles Integration
- Roster table: Each player links to player profile
- Player cards (S/M/L): Imported component for previews
- Key players: Use player card component
- All-time leaders: Link to retired players' profiles

### Stadium Integration
- Header: Stadium name links to stadium page
- Home games: Show stadium details
- Stadium page: Cross-reference with team page

### Matchup Preview Integration
- Next game section: Link to matchup preview page
- Schedule: Each upcoming game links to matchup preview

### Game Details Integration
- Schedule: Each completed game links to game-details page
- Last game: Link to full game recap
- Season schedule: Deep linking to all games

### Business Data Integration (Future)
- Ownership, valuation, payroll
- To be integrated in future phase
