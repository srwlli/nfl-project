## Critical Data Gaps

### High Priority Gaps

1. **Contract Data (2 fields - P0)** ❌
   - Cap hit, years remaining
   - **Impact:** Impacts 2 roster fields per player (×70 players = 140 occurrences)
   - **Solution Options:**
     - Paid API: OverTheCap ($), Spotrac ($$)
     - Manual entry: 30-60 min/week during season
     - Skip: Mark as "Contract details not available"

2. **Coaching Staff Directory (30 fields - P0)** 🔧
   - Head coach, coordinators, position coaches
   - **Impact:** Major gap in P0 coverage
   - **Solution:** One-time manual curation (96 hours)
   - **Ongoing:** Update when coaching changes occur

### Medium Priority Gaps

3. **Official Injury Reports (3 fields - P1)** 🔧
   - Practice participation (Wed/Thu/Fri)
   - **Impact:** Affects injury report accuracy
   - **Solution:** Manual entry from official NFL reports (2-3 hours/week)

4. **News Articles Feed (8 fields - P1)** 🔧
   - Article title, summary, URL, thumbnail
   - **Impact:** News section empty without it
   - **Solution:** ESPN API integration (1-2 weeks)

### Low Priority Gaps

5. **Franchise History Details (15 fields - P2)** 🔧
   - Super Bowl wins, retired numbers, HOF members
   - **Impact:** Historical context missing
   - **Solution:** One-time manual curation (64 hours)

6. **All-Time Leaders (12 fields - P2)** ⚠️
   - Top passers, rushers, receivers by team
   - **Impact:** "All-Time Leaders" section incomplete
   - **Solution:** sportsref_nfl aggregation or manual research

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

1. **Contract Data Availability**
   - **Risk:** No free API available for contract details
   - **Mitigation:** Accept 2-field gap OR allocate budget for paid API
   - **Impact:** Minor (affects optional roster fields)

2. **Manual Curation Workload**
   - **Risk:** 176 hours one-time + 20+ hours/week ongoing
   - **Mitigation:** Prioritize P0 coaching staff, defer P2 history
   - **Impact:** Delays full launch if not resourced

### Medium Risk Items

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - **Risk:** ESPN API, The Odds API have rate limits
   - **Mitigation:** Implement caching, request throttling
   - **Impact:** May slow data refresh during peak times

4. **Data Accuracy**
   - **Risk:** Manual entry prone to errors
   - **Mitigation:** Data validation workflows, periodic audits
   - **Impact:** User trust if inaccurate data displayed

### Low Risk Items

5. **Depth Chart Maintenance**
   - **Risk:** Weekly updates labor-intensive
   - **Mitigation:** Automated scraping from team sites
   - **Impact:** Depth charts may be stale if not updated

## Legend

- ✅ **Available** - Data exists in current database/system, ready to display
- ⚠️ **Partial** - Data partially available, needs enhancement, calculation, or integration
- 🔧 **Planned** - Source identified, integration or manual curation required
- ❌ **Missing** - No clear source, requires premium service or significant manual effort

---

**Status:** COMPLETE - All 284 fields analyzed, mapped to sources, and full implementation plan defined.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Agentic coding - no timeframes, no phases
- Full implementation IS the MVP
- Manual curation: 176 hours one-time + ongoing maintenance
- Budget: $0 (all free sources) OR $500-1000/year for contract API (optional)

**Next Steps:**
1. Begin full implementation (all components in parallel)
2. Complete manual curation for all 32 teams (coaching staff, franchise history)
3. Evaluate contract data API options or document limitation
4. Establish ongoing maintenance workflows (depth charts, injuries, news)
