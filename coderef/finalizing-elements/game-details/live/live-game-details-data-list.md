## Real-Time Update Strategy

### WebSocket vs Polling
**Recommendation:** Hybrid approach
- **WebSocket:** For play-by-play updates (ESPN may offer WebSocket endpoints)
- **Polling:** For live stats, betting lines (every 15-30 seconds)

### Polling Intervals
| Data Element | Interval |
|--------------|----------|
| Game Header / Score | 10-15 seconds |
| Play-by-Play Feed | 5-10 seconds (or WebSocket) |
| Box Score Stats | 30 seconds |
| Team Stats | 30-60 seconds |
| Betting Lines | 15-30 seconds |
| Win Probability | After each play (via pbp update) |

---

## Caching Strategy (Redis)

- **Live game state:** 10-second TTL
- **Box score stats:** 30-second TTL
- **Team stats:** 60-second TTL
- **Play-by-play feed:** 5-second TTL
- **Invalidate cache on new play detection**

---

## Progressive Loading

1. **Initial Load (<1s):** Game header, current score, possession, down/distance
2. **Secondary Load (1-2s):** Score breakdown, last play summary, live drive tracker
3. **Tertiary Load (2-3s):** Recent plays feed, live box score, team stats
4. **On-Demand:** Win probability chart, EPA (when Advanced tab clicked)

---

## Mobile Optimization

### Priority on Small Screens
- **Above fold:** Current score, quarter, time, possession, down & distance
- **Sticky header:** Score stays visible when scrolling
- **Compact stats:** Key stats only (total yards, turnovers, time of possession)
- **Auto-refresh toggle:** Allow users to pause updates (save battery/data)

### Data Usage Optimization
- **Delta updates:** Only send changed data (new plays, updated stats)
- **Compressed JSON**
- **Server-sent events (SSE):** Lightweight streaming alternative to WebSocket

---

## User Actions During Live Game

1. **Auto-refresh toggle:** Pause/resume live updates
2. **Notification preferences:** Alert on scores, turnovers, big plays (20+ yards)
3. **Minimize mode:** Compact view (score, possession, time only)
4. **Expand play:** Click play description for full details
5. **Share play:** Share specific play to social media
6. **Compare to pre-game lines:** Show original betting lines vs current

---

## Data Gaps & Recommendations

**Available Now:**
- ‚úÖ Game ID, teams, scores (nflreadpy, ESPN API)
- ‚úÖ Play-by-play descriptions (nflreadpy pbp)
- ‚úÖ Down, distance, yardline (nflreadpy)
- ‚úÖ Win probability, EPA (nflreadpy)
- ‚úÖ Player stats (partial - can aggregate from pbp)

**Needs Integration:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time ESPN API for live games (not yet integrated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è WebSocket or polling mechanism (not implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Live betting lines (The Odds API integration exists but not real-time)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Quarter-by-quarter scores (needs ESPN API or pbp aggregation logic)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Live highlights/videos (ESPN API or YouTube integration needed)

**Recommendation:**
Integrate ESPN live endpoints with 10-15 second polling for P0 data, 30-60 second polling for P1 data. Consider WebSocket upgrade for high-traffic games. Implement Redis caching with 10-60 second TTLs. Build real-time stats aggregation engine from play-by-play data.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Endpoints Needed

**ESPN API (Primary Live Source):**
- `GET /sports/football/nfl/scoreboard` - Live scores and game status
- `GET /sports/football/nfl/summary?event={game_id}` - Live game details
- `GET /sports/football/nfl/playbyplay?event={game_id}` - Real-time plays
- `GET /sports/football/nfl/boxscore?event={game_id}` - Live stats

**The Odds API (Live Betting Lines):**
- `GET /v4/sports/americanfootball_nfl/odds?markets=spreads,totals&bookmakers=draftkings`

**nflreadpy (Real-Time PBP Ingestion):**
- Load latest play-by-play data for in-progress games
- Filter to current game_id
- Parse live columns: desc, yards_gained, down, ydstogo, yardline_100, drive, wp, epa

### Error Handling
- **API timeout:** Retry 3x with exponential backoff
- **Missing play:** Alert monitoring, log error, continue with next update
- **Invalid data:** Validate against schema, discard if invalid
- **Cache failure:** Fallback to direct API call

### Performance Optimization
- **Debounce updates:** Don't update UI more than once per second
- **Batch stat calculations:** Calculate all team stats in single pass
- **Lazy load charts:** Only render win probability/EPA when tab is active
