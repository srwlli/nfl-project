## COLOR & VISUAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Color Usage
- **Team Colors** - Use official team colors for branding
- **Status Colors** - Green (winning), Red (losing), Yellow (tied/close)
- **Contextual Highlights** - Touchdowns (gold/yellow), Turnovers (red)
- **Neutral Base** - Gray/white backgrounds for readability

### Typography
- **Scores** - Largest, bold weight
- **Team Names** - Medium-large, semi-bold
- **Stats Headers** - All caps, small, gray
- **Stats Values** - Medium size, regular weight
- **Emphasis** - Bold for leaders, highlights

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Score is king - largest element
2. Teams and game status - prominent
3. Navigation - clear but not dominant
4. Stats - scannable, organized, not overwhelming

---

## PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### Loading Strategy
- **Critical CSS** - Inline styles for above-fold content
- **Lazy Load** - Delay loading play-by-play, videos
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Show basic stats first, enhance with charts
- **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket for live games, polling for near-real-time

### Data Optimization
- **API Design** - Separate endpoints for each tab
- **Caching** - Aggressive caching for final games
- **Compression** - Gzip/Brotli for all responses
- **CDN** - Cache static assets and finalized game data

---

## ACCESSIBILITY

### WCAG 2.1 Compliance
- **Semantic HTML** - Proper heading hierarchy, table markup
- **ARIA Labels** - Descriptive labels for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard accessibility
- **Color Contrast** - 4.5:1 minimum for text
- **Focus Indicators** - Clear visual focus states
- **Alt Text** - Descriptive text for logos, player images

---

## USER ENGAGEMENT FEATURES

### Interactive Elements
1. **Favorite Teams** - Save and highlight preferred teams
2. **Share Functionality** - Share game summary, specific plays
3. **Alerts** - Score updates, game start notifications
4. **Compare Players** - Head-to-head stat comparison
5. **Filter Stats** - Sort tables, filter by position

- **Charts** - D3.js, Chart.js, or Recharts for visualizations
- **Real-time** - Socket.io or native WebSockets for live updates
- **Styling** - Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive development
