🏈 Theme Name: "Fourth & Forever"
🧠 Core Theme Concept:

A gritty, high-impact design inspired by the tension of a 4th down play with the game on the line. It leans into the intensity, bold visuals, and real-time urgency of NFL Sundays. Think "RedZone meets SportsCenter meets game-winning drive".

🎨 Visual Style:

Dark mode base with deep slate & matte black backgrounds — like a night game under the lights.

Accent colors driven by context:

green for wins, covers, and clutch plays

red for turnovers, losses, critical flags

amber for milestones, records, and playoff implications

Fonts:

Headline: Condensed, uppercase slab serif like Anton or Impact for energy

Body: Clean sans-serif like Inter, Roboto, or Satoshi for readability

🧩 Component Feel:

Badges look like ESPN’s lower-thirds — sharp, confident, punchy.

Tables feel like command centers: zebra-striped rows, animated hover reveals, and sticky headers.

Charts pulse in real-time with dynamic gradients like Next Gen Stats.

Tabs snap like channel switches on a remote — fast, smooth, satisfying.

🎥 Motion & Interaction:

Subtle tilt/scale on hover for highlight videos

Quarter score updates with sliding animations, mimicking scoreboard flips

Progress bars animate in when scrolled into view (like loading power meters)
