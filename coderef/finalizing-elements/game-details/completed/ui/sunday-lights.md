Let’s go again — this one is *vibey*, immersive, and all about **emotional storytelling through atmosphere**:

---

### 🌌 **Theme Name**: "Sunday Lights"

---

### 🧠 **Core Theme Concept**:

A cinematic, atmospheric design channeling the vibe of **NFL primetime games** — bright stadium lights cutting through night skies, the hum of the crowd, and that electric tension in the air. It’s moody, bold, and emotionally charged — a UI that *feels* like a night game.

---

### 🎨 **Visual Style**:

* **Deep gradients**: Midnight navy → obsidian black, layered with occasional flares of spotlight white, electric blue, and turf green
* **Glow accents** on key stats, scores, and badges to simulate **stadium lighting**
* Hero sections styled like movie posters or promo banners (players in dramatic poses, fog overlays, bold title typography)

---

### 🎬 **Typography**:

* **Headline**: All-caps, stretched fonts like *Bebas Neue* or *Oswald* — tall, athletic, dramatic
* **Body**: Clean modern sans like *DM Sans* or *Outfit*, ensuring balance

---

### 🎯 **Component Feel**:

* **Cards** with drop shadows and inner glows, giving a sense of depth
* **Video highlights** styled like a Netflix carousel: horizontal scroll with parallax hover zooms
* **Badges & tags** look like light-up stadium signage — crisp, glowing, unmistakable
* Quarter-by-quarter or EPA charts resemble **stadium jumbotrons** with large, backlit digits

---

### 🎥 **Motion & Interaction**:

* Slow **fade-ins from darkness** — as if lights are coming on
* **Hover transitions** with light sweeps across components (like stage spotlights)
* **Game-winning play cards** flash with a subtle camera shutter effect

---

### 🌟 Optional Layers:

* **“Spotlight of the Game”**: Featured moment or player floats above the fold with a dramatic overlay
* **“Tunnel Cam”** style background option: grainy visuals of pregame warmups, behind-the-scenes footage

`#PrimetimeEnergy`, `#UnderTheLights`, `#StadiumVibes`, `#CinematicGridiron`

This theme is built for drama — like a **Monday Night Football intro met Apple Vision Pro UI**.
