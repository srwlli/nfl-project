🧪 Theme Name: "Next Down Metrics"
🧠 Core Theme Concept:

A hypermodern, data-first interface inspired by NFL Next Gen Stats, advanced analytics dashboards, and sideline tablet tech. Sleek. Minimal. Smart. Designed for fans who watch football like it’s chess with pads.

🎨 Visual Style:

Monochrome grayscale base — black, gunmetal, and space gray

Accent gradients tied to performance:

Green ➝ Efficiency

Red ➝ Risk

Blue ➝ Clutch

Purple ➝ X-Factor

Clean neon-style edge glows or data pings used sparingly

🧮 Typography:

Display: Futuristic mono fonts like JetBrains Mono or Space Grotesk

Body: Geometric sans-serifs like Neue Haas Grotesk or Manrope

🧩 Component Feel:

Scorebug looks like a heads-up display (HUD) — floating, grid-aligned, with dynamic edges

Charts resemble GPS systems or aircraft telemetry

Badges pulse with animated borders when active

Quarter scores and stat tables live-update smoothly (like stock tickers)

⚙️ Motion & Interaction:

Hover triggers holographic lighting beneath elements

Tabs & navigation have tactile snap effects — you can feel the UI react

Progress meters for EPA, success rate, win prob. animate with data visualization-inspired arcs and bars

🧠 Smart Layer Suggestions:

"Edge Indicator" — automatically highlights which team had the analytics edge per quarter

"AI Insight Bar" — optional tooltip panel to show suggested 4th down decisions or expected completion probability

This one is made to feel like you’re watching the game in a NASA command center. Should I prototype this in React + Tailwind, or do you want to combine elements from all 3 themes into a hybrid? 💡📊🏈
