## 📋 Phase 1: Critical Improvements (2-3 hours)

### Deliverable 1.1: Opponent Defensive Efficiency Factor
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Function to calculate opponent defensive efficiency per stat category
- League-wide averages for normalization
- Opponent factor applied to projections (0.7-1.3 range)

**Output Example:**
```
Baker Mayfield vs DET (allows 245 yds/game, league avg 230)
  Base Expected: 277.1 yards
  Opponent Factor: 1.06 (easier matchup)
  Adjusted Expected: 293.7 yards
  Floor: 236.2 → 250.8 (improved)
```

**Code Changes:**
- New function: `calculateOpponentFactor(opponentId, statCategory, season)`
- New query: Aggregate `team_game_stats` for defensive metrics
- Updated: `calculateStatFloor()` to apply opponent factor

**Testing:**
- Verify opponent factors range 0.7-1.3
- Compare projections vs tough defenses (SF, BAL) vs weak defenses (CAR, NYG)

---

### Deliverable 1.2: Filter Incomplete Games
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Only use stats from completed games (`status = 'final'`)
- Exclude scheduled/in-progress games from calculations

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Add to game query
.eq('status', 'final')
```

**Testing:**
- Verify Week 7 scheduled games don't affect calculations
- Confirm only Weeks 1-6 final games used

---

### Deliverable 1.3: Batch Database Queries
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- 10x faster execution (from ~8s to ~800ms per game)
- Parallel player stat fetching with `Promise.all()`
- Single joined query for games + stats

**Code Changes:**
- Refactor: `calculateTeamFloors()` to use `Promise.all()`
- New: Single joined query for player stats + game weeks

**Performance Metrics:**
```
Before: 8,000ms per game (30 sequential queries)
After:  800ms per game (3 parallel batches)
Improvement: 90% faster
```

---

### Deliverable 1.4: Dynamic Volatility by Position
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Position-specific volatility factors
- Tighter floors for consistent positions (QB)
- Wider floors for volatile positions (WR)

**Configuration:**
```javascript
position_volatility: {
  QB: 0.6,   // Most consistent
  RB: 0.8,   // Medium variance
  WR: 0.9,   // Highest variance
  TE: 0.75   // Medium-high
}
```

**Output Example:**
```
// Before (all positions use 0.75)
Baker Mayfield (QB): Floor 219.6 (58 yards below expected)
Emeka Egbuka (WR):   Floor 50.6 (38 yards below expected)

// After (position-specific)
Baker Mayfield (QB): Floor 232.4 (45 yards below expected) ✅ Tighter
Emeka Egbuka (WR):   Floor 44.7 (44 yards below expected) ✅ Wider
```

---

## 📋 Phase 2: High Impact (2-3 hours)

**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Venue modifiers (turf vs grass, dome vs outdoor)
- Weather context integration
- Home/away adjustments

**Data Sources:**
- `stadiums` table (surface_type, roof_type)
- `game_weather` table (temperature, wind, precipitation)

**Modifiers:**
```javascript
venue_modifiers: {
  turf: 1.03,      // Faster surface
  grass: 1.00,     // Baseline
  dome: 1.02,      // Controlled environment
  outdoor: 1.00    // Baseline
}

weather_penalties: {
  high_wind: 0.95,       // >15 mph
  precipitation: 0.92,   // Rain/snow
  extreme_cold: 0.94     // <25°F
}
```

**Output Example:**
```
Baker Mayfield @ DET
  Base Expected: 277.1 yards
  Venue: Ford Field (dome, turf) → 1.05x modifier
  Weather: Indoor (no penalty)
  Adjusted Expected: 291.0 yards
```

---

### Deliverable 2.2: Opportunity-Based Projections
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Two-step projection: Opportunities × Efficiency
- More accurate for pass-catchers (targets matter!)
- Better volatility estimation

**Formula:**
```javascript
// Step 1: Project opportunities
projected_targets = (season_avg_targets × 0.4) + (recent_avg_targets × 0.6)

// Step 2: Calculate efficiency
yards_per_target = receiving_yards / receiving_targets

// Step 3: Final projection
expected_yards = projected_targets × yards_per_target
```

**Output Example:**
```
Amon-Ra St. Brown
  Projected Targets: 9.2 (season: 9.5, recent: 9.0)
  Yards per Target: 7.8
  Expected Yards: 71.8 (vs old method: 72.2)
  Better captures target volume changes
```

---

### Deliverable 2.3: Adaptive Rolling Window
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Position-specific lookback windows
- QBs use 4-5 weeks (more stable)
- RBs use 2-3 weeks (more volatile)

**Configuration:**
```javascript
rolling_window_by_position: {
  QB: 5,   // Most stable
  RB: 3,   // Volatile (injuries, game scripts)
  WR: 4,   // Medium
  TE: 4    // Medium
}
```

**Impact:**
- Better recent form capture for RBs
- More stable baselines for QBs

---

### Deliverable 2.4: Percentile-Based Floors
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- 15th percentile of historical outcomes as floor
- More realistic "worst-case" scenarios
- Better calibrated than linear subtraction

**Formula:**
```javascript
// Before: Linear
floor = expected - (std_dev × 0.75)

// After: Percentile-based
floor = percentile_15(player_historical_outcomes)
```

**Example:**
```
Baker Mayfield (4 games: 180, 220, 285, 315)
  Old Floor: 219.6 (linear calculation)
  New Floor: 195.0 (15th percentile = actual low performance)
  More realistic!
```

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Refinement (2-3 hours)

### Deliverable 3.1: Advanced Metrics Integration
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- EPA (Expected Points Added) for efficiency weighting
- QBR for QB-specific confidence scores
- Success rate for consistency metrics
- Red zone touches for TD upside

**Usage:**
```javascript
// QB Confidence Boost
if (qbr > 75) confidence_multiplier = 1.1
if (qbr < 40) confidence_multiplier = 0.9

// RB TD Upside
if (red_zone_touches > 3) td_floor = 0.5 (vs 0.0)

// Efficiency Filter
if (success_rate < 35%) apply_penalty = 0.95
```

---

### Deliverable 3.2: Bayesian Shrinkage
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Small sample adjustments (rookies, returning players)
- Shrink toward positional mean when data is limited
- Confidence scaling based on sample size

**Formula:**
```javascript
// Weight personal stats vs position average
shrinkage_weight = games_played / (games_played + 5)

adjusted_expected =
  (player_avg × shrinkage_weight) +
  (position_avg × (1 - shrinkage_weight))
```

**Example:**
```
Rookie WR with 2 games (150, 80 yards)
  Raw Average: 115 yards
  Position Average: 55 yards
  Shrinkage Weight: 2/(2+5) = 0.286
  Adjusted Expected: (115 × 0.286) + (55 × 0.714) = 72.2 yards
  More conservative for small samples!
```

---

### Deliverable 3.3: Data Validation Suite
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Pre-flight data completeness checks
- Schema validation against DATABASE-SCHEMA-REFERENCE.md
- Cross-table integrity checks
- Warning system for missing data

**Checks:**
```javascript
✅ Verify player exists in players table
✅ Check minimum games threshold met
✅ Validate fantasy_points_ppr consistency
✅ Confirm opponent team exists
✅ Check for null values in critical fields
⚠️  Warn if missing weeks of data
⚠️  Warn if opponent has incomplete defensive stats
```

---

### Deliverable 3.4: Injury Filter Implementation
**File:** `scripts/calculate-performance-floors.js`

**What You'll Get:**
- Check `player_injury_status` table
- Exclude OUT/DOUBTFUL players
- Flag QUESTIONABLE players with warning

**Code:**
```javascript
const { data: injuries } = await supabase
  .from('player_injury_status')
  .select('player_id, injury_status')
  .in('player_id', uniquePlayerIds)
  .eq('season', season)

// Filter logic
if (injury_status === 'out' || injury_status === 'doubtful') {
  return null  // Skip player
}

if (injury_status === 'questionable') {
  player.injury_warning = true  // Flag with ⚠️
}
```

**Output:**
```
Bucky Irving (RB, TB) ❌ EXCLUDED (OUT - Toe)
Mike Evans (WR, TB) ⚠️  QUESTIONABLE (Hamstring)
  Rec Yds: Floor 35.3 | Expected 42.0 | Ceiling 48.8

# Performance Floors Formula

## Formula Components

1. **Base Expected**
   Expected = (season_avg × 0.4) + (recent_avg × 0.6)

2. **Opponent Adjustment**
   opponent_factor = opponent_avg_allowed / league_avg_allowed
   Range: 0.7 (tough) to 1.3 (easy)

3. **Environment Modifiers**
   - Venue: turf (+3%), dome (+2%)
   - Weather: wind/rain (-5-8%)

4. **Final Floor**
   floor = MAX(position_min, percentile_15(outcomes))

## Tuning Guide

- Increase volatility_factor → Wider floors (more conservative)
- Decrease recent_weight → More stable projections
- Increase rolling_window → Smoother averages
```
