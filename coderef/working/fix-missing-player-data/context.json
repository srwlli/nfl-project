  "description": "Fix missing player data causing foreign key errors when scraping game stats. 26 games (out of 106 completed) are failing to import player stats because ~12 players are missing from the players table. These are mid-season roster additions not present in the original seed.",
  "goal": "Achieve 100% game coverage (106/106 games with player stats) by adding missing players and re-scraping affected games",
  "requirements": [
    "Re-run player roster seed (03-players.js) to add missing ~12 players",
    "Identify and list all 26 games currently failing due to FK errors",
    "Re-scrape the 26 affected games after players are added",
    "Verify 100% coverage (106/106 games have player_game_stats)",
    "Document the missing player IDs and which games they affected"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [],
  "constraints": [
    "Must use existing seed script (03-players.js) - already has UPSERT logic",
    "Rate limiting: ESPN API allows 1 req/sec",
    "Foreign key constraints prevent stats insertion without players",
    "Cannot modify database schema - must add missing players first"
