## Formula & Methodology

### Enhanced Formula (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
```
Expected = (recent_avg × opponent_modifier × environment_modifier)
Floor = Percentile_15(actual_outcomes)
```

### Key Components

**1. Opponent Defensive Efficiency** (Phase 1)
- Adjusts for opponent strength
- Range: 0.7 - 1.3
- Weaker defense = higher projection

**2. Completed Games Filter** (Phase 1)
- Only uses `status='final'` games
- Ensures accuracy

**3. Batch Query Optimization** (Phase 1)
- 90% faster execution
- 800ms vs 8,000ms per game

**4. Position-Specific Volatility** (Phase 1)
- QB: 0.6 (most stable)
- RB: 0.8
- WR: 0.9 (most volatile)
- TE: 0.75

**5. Environment Modifiers** (Phase 2)
- **Turf**: +3%
- **Dome**: +2%
- **High wind**: -5%
- **Precipitation**: -8%
- **Extreme cold**: -6%

**6. Opportunity-Based Projections** (Phase 2)
- Two-step model: opportunities × efficiency
- More accurate for volume stats

**7. Adaptive Rolling Window** (Phase 2)
- QB: 5 games
- RB: 3 games
- WR: 4 games
- TE: 4 games

**8. Percentile-Based Floors** (Phase 2)
- 15th percentile of actual outcomes
- More realistic than linear σ-based

**9. Data Validation** (Phase 3)
- Pre-flight validation before processing
- Checks game data, teams, players, stats

**10. Injury Filter** (Phase 3)
- Excludes OUT/DOUBTFUL players
- Flags QUESTIONABLE players

## Example Output Interpretation

### Fantasy Points Projection
```
Floor: 15.8 | Expected: 21.3 | Ceiling: 26.8
```

**Floor (15.8)**: Conservative estimate (15th percentile)
- Use for: Risk-averse decisions, cash games
- Confidence: ~85% chance player exceeds this

**Expected (21.3)**: Most likely outcome (50th percentile)
- Use for: Standard projections, season-long
- Confidence: ~50% chance player exceeds this

**Ceiling (26.8)**: Optimistic estimate (85th percentile)
- Use for: Tournament plays, GPP lineups
- Confidence: ~15% chance player exceeds this

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### 1. Use Floors for Cash Games
Minimize risk by selecting players with high floors

### 2. Use Ceilings for Tournaments
Maximize upside by selecting players with high ceilings

### 3. Compare Props to Vegas Lines
Look for value where your projection differs from bookmakers

### 4. Account for Injuries
Script auto-excludes OUT/DOUBTFUL, but check QUESTIONABLE

### 5. Consider Game Script
High-scoring games increase volume for all players

### 6. Weather Matters
Script auto-adjusts for wind/rain/cold, but be aware
