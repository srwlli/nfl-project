## Implementation Notes

### Data Requirements

To calculate this score automatically, you need:

1. **Play-by-play data**
   - Score progression (for lead changes, comeback tracking)
   - Explosive plays (40+ yard plays)
   - 4th quarter/OT play data

2. **Game metadata**
   - Final score
   - Week number / playoff round
   - Playoff implications
   - Spread/betting lines
   - Viewership data (if available)

3. **Team/player statistics**
   - Red zone attempts/TDs
   - Turnovers
   - QB rating by quarter
   - Individual records

4. **Historical context** (manual/curated data)
   - Dynasty status
   - Franchise championship droughts
   - Notable "firsts"
   - Record-breaking performances

### Database Schema Additions

Consider adding these tables/columns:

```sql
-- Game analysis table
CREATE TABLE game_greatness_scores (
  game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  drama_score INTEGER,
  stakes_multiplier DECIMAL(3,1),
  offensive_fireworks INTEGER,
  historical_significance INTEGER,
  execution_excellence INTEGER,
  contextual_factors INTEGER,
  total_score INTEGER,
  tier TEXT, -- Legendary, Epic, Memorable, Exciting, Standard
  calculated_at TIMESTAMP,
  notes TEXT
);

-- Lead changes tracking
CREATE TABLE game_lead_changes (
  game_id TEXT,
  quarter INTEGER,
  time_remaining_seconds INTEGER,
  new_leader TEXT, -- team_id or 'TIE'
  score_home INTEGER,
  score_away INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY (game_id, quarter, time_remaining_seconds)
);

-- Historical significance flags
CREATE TABLE game_historical_flags (
  game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  is_record_breaking BOOLEAN,
  is_dynasty_impact BOOLEAN,
  is_franchise_milestone BOOLEAN,
  is_historical_first BOOLEAN,
  significance_notes TEXT
);
```

### Automation Strategy

1. **Real-time calculation** during/after game completion
2. **Historical recalculation** as more context emerges (dynasty impact, player legacies)
3. **Manual overrides** for subjective historical significance
4. **Periodic re-ranking** as new all-time greats emerge

### User Interface

Display greatest games as:
- **All-Time Greatest**: Top 100 games ranked by score
- **Season's Best**: Top games from current/selected season
- **Team's Greatest**: Best games in franchise history
- **Playoff Classics**: Best playoff games only
- **Regular Season Gems**: Best non-playoff games

Each game card shows:
- Final score
- Tier badge (Legendary/Epic/Memorable)
- Key metrics (comeback size, lead changes, OT)
- Highlight narrative (e.g., "28-3 comeback in first OT Super Bowl")

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Component**
   - Train on fan voting/sentiment data
   - Social media engagement metrics
   - Adjust weights based on historical consensus

2. **Individual Play Analysis**
   - Identify "signature moments" within games
   - Weight based on Win Probability Added

3. **Narrative Detection**
   - NLP analysis of game recaps/articles
   - Detect storylines (redemption, rivalry, underdog)

4. **Fan Voting Integration**
   - Allow users to submit their "greatest games"
   - Combine algorithmic + community rankings

5. **Video Highlights Integration**
   - Automatically tag greatest games for highlight reels
   - YouTube/social media optimization

## Conclusion

This algorithm provides a quantifiable, reproducible way to identify the NFL's greatest games while balancing objective metrics (scores, stats) with contextual significance (history, stakes).

The formula is designed to be:
- **Data-driven**: Uses available statistics
- **Flexible**: Weights can be tuned based on preferences
- **Transparent**: Each component is clearly defined
- **Scalable**: Can be applied to historical and future games

Greatest games aren't just about close scores—they're about **dramatic moments**, **high stakes**, **historical impact**, and **unforgettable performances** that transcend the sport.
