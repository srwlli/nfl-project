floors improvements 

Here‚Äôs a **precise, structured review** of your `calculate-performance-floors.js` script, with improvements specifically targeted at increasing **accuracy**, reliability, and data integration consistency based on your Supabase data inventory (`AVAILABLE-DATA-INVENTORY.md`).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Data Model Accuracy Issues

### üî∏ Use Latest Available Fields

Your code uses a subset of player stats (`passing_yards`, `rushing_yards`, `receiving_yards`, etc.) but **ignores key Phase 1 fields** now available:

* `passing_rating`, `qbr`
* `receiving_receptions`, `receiving_targets`
* `fantasy_points_standard`, `fantasy_points_half_ppr`
* `epa_total`, `success_rate`, `red_zone_touches`

**Improve**:

* Extend `getStatCategories()` to optionally include these advanced metrics.
* Adjust calculations to weight `success_rate` and `epa_total` for confidence calibration.

```js
// Example extension for QB
QB: [
  { stat: 'passing_yards', opportunity: 'passing_attempts', label: 'Passing Yards' },
  { stat: 'passing_rating', opportunity: 'passing_attempts', label: 'Passer Rating' },
  { stat: 'fantasy_points_ppr', opportunity: 'passing_attempts', label: 'Fantasy Points' }
]
```

---

## üìà 2. Formula and Statistical Accuracy

### üî∏ Weighted Expectation Too Simplistic

`expected = (seasonAvg * 0.4) + (recentAvg * 0.6)` assumes uniform opponent and environment effects.

**Improve**:

* Integrate **opponent-adjusted modifiers** from `team_game_stats`:

  * Use opponent‚Äôs **defensive efficiency proxy**: e.g., yards allowed / game or fantasy_points_allowed / game.
* Add a **game environment modifier (pace or Vegas implied total)** from `games` or derived from average total points.

```js
const opponentModifier = 1 - (oppDefenseYardsAllowed / leagueAvgDefenseYardsAllowed)
const expected = ((seasonAvg * 0.4) + (recentAvg * 0.6)) * (1 + opponentModifier * 0.25)
```

---

## üìä 3. Confidence and Variance Estimation

### üî∏ Confidence Score Simplistic

`cv = stdDev / mean` doesn‚Äôt capture true player stability (especially small n).

**Improve**:

* Use **log-normalized stability** for skewed stats.
* Blend in **sample size weighting by recency**.
* Consider **Bayesian shrinkage** to avoid overconfidence with small samples.

```js
const weightedStdDev = Math.sqrt(weightedVariance(recentGames, seasonStats))
const bayesianConfidence = 1 / (1 + (weightedStdDev / mean)**2)
```

---

## üßÆ 4. Sample Selection Logic

### üî∏ Static 3-week window

The fixed `rolling_window_weeks = 3` underrepresents high-volume positions.

**Improve**:

* Make adaptive:

  * 4‚Äì5 weeks for QBs/WRs, 2‚Äì3 for RBs.
  * Scale window by `games_played` or `snap_share`.

```js
const windowSize = player.position === 'QB' ? 5 : player.position === 'RB' ? 3 : 4
```

---

## üß© 5. Database Query Efficiency and Accuracy

### üî∏ Missing `status = 'final'` filter

Your player data queries don‚Äôt exclude in-progress or scheduled games.

**Improve**:

```js
.eq('games.status', 'final')
```

### üî∏ Use joins for fewer roundtrips

Multiple `.from('player_game_stats')` and `.from('players')` calls are redundant.

**Improve**:
Use a single joined query:

```js
const { data: playerStats } = await supabase
  .from('player_game_stats')
  .select(`
    player_id,
    team_id,
    position,
    games(week, status),
    players(full_name)
  `)
  .eq('season', season)
  .eq('team_id', teamId)
  .gte('games.week', week - windowSize)
  .lt('games.week', week)
  .eq('games.status', 'final')
```

---

## üîç 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases

### üî∏ Missing Error Guards

When Supabase returns `null` or rate-limits, the script just logs and continues.

**Improve**:

* Centralize fetch handling with retries/backoff.
* Validate schema consistency using available field metadata (from `AVAILABLE-DATA-INVENTORY.md`).

---

## üìâ 7. Reporting Accuracy

### üî∏ ‚ÄúFloor‚Äù Definition

The current `floor = expected - (œÉ √ó volatility_factor)` can yield **negative values for yards** and misrepresent **touchdowns**.

**Improve**:

* Clamp to position-specific realistic minimums (e.g., RB ‚â• 5 yards).
* Apply empirical percentile mapping (e.g., 15th percentile rather than linear subtraction).

---

## üß† 8. Structural & Code Quality

* Convert script to **module pattern** for testability (export functions).
* Add **unit tests** for `calculateConfidence()` and `calculateStatFloor()`.
* Use async batching for Supabase calls via `Promise.all()` to reduce latency by ~80%.
* Split display concerns into a separate renderer (CLI/UI agnostic).

This is a fantastic start to a comprehensive projection model\! The data structure, which you provided in `AVAILABLE-DATA-INVENTORY.md`, is rich and well-organized, offering many fields (like **EPA, air\_yards, and QBR**) that are not yet utilized in the prediction logic in `calculate-performance-floors.js`.

The current model in `calculate-performance-floors.js` is essentially a **volatility-adjusted weighted average** based on historical performance, which is a great foundation.

To make the app significantly more **accurate** (predictive) and **robust** (less sensitive to variance), you need to incorporate the opponent's defense and the game environment.

Here is a precise list of improvements, broken down by complexity, to enhance the accuracy of your `calculate-performance-floors.js` script.

-----

## 1\. Core Accuracy Improvements (High Impact)

The current model calculates `Expected = (season_avg * 0.4) + (recent_avg * 0.6)`. This equation is **missing the opponent factor** (O) and **game environment factor** (G) mentioned in your function's description.

### A. Implement Opponent Defensive Efficiency (O)

This is the single biggest missing piece for accuracy. A player's floor against the 32nd-ranked defense should be higher than against the 1st-ranked defense.

| File | Change | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `calculate-performance-floors.js` | **Add `getOpponentFactor()`** | Create a new function to calculate how good the opposing team (`opponentId`) is at defending the specific stat category (e.g., fantasy points, rushing yards) *per game*. |
| `calculate-performance-floors.js` | **Update `calculateStatFloor()`** | Change the calculation to: <br>`Expected = (Weighted Average) √ó Opponent Factor` |
| `Database Access` | **Query `team_game_stats`** | The `getOpponentFactor` function will need to query the `team_game_stats` table to calculate the season-to-date *average yards/points allowed* by the opponent's defense, and normalize it against the league average. |

**Proposed Opponent Factor Logic:**

1.  **League Average (LA):** Calculate the mean of `statField` (e.g., `receiving_yards`) across **all** teams in **all** completed games up to the current week.
2.  **Opponent Allowed Average (OAA):** Calculate the average `statField` allowed by the `opponentId`'s defense this season.
3.  **Opponent Factor:** `Opponent Factor = OAA / LA`.
      * *Example:* If the opponent gives up 1.2x the league average in Receiving Yards, the factor is `1.2`.
4.  **New Expected Calculation:** `Expected = ((seasonAvg * 0.4) + (recentAvg * 0.6)) √ó Opponent Factor`

### B. Implement Game Environment Modifier (G)

The game context influences offensive pace and usage.

| File | Change | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `calculate-performance-floors.js` | **Query `games` and `stadiums`** | In `calculateFloorsForGame`, fetch the **venue\_name** and **surface\_type** (from the joined `stadiums` table). |
| `calculate-performance-floors.js` | **Add `getVenueModifier()`** | Create a function that returns a modifier based on the environment. |

**Proposed Environment Logic:**

  * **Turf vs. Grass:** RBs and WRs on turf surfaces often have slightly higher rushing and receiving yards. Use a small multiplier (e.g., `1.03` for turf, `1.00` for grass) to slightly boost expected performance for speed/skill positions on turf.

-----

## 2\. Model Refinement (Medium Impact)

These changes refine the input data and the calculation of the floor/ceiling itself.

### A. Dynamically Adjust Volatility Factor

The current **`volatility_factor: 0.75`** is a fixed constant. Players with higher confidence (lower CV) should have a factor closer to `1.0` (tighter range), while high-variance players (lower confidence) should use a lower factor (closer to `0.5`) to create a wider, more realistic floor/ceiling range.

**Improvement:** In `calculateStatFloor`, instead of using `CONFIG.volatility_factor`, use a **modified confidence score** derived from `confidence` to dynamically set the conservatism of the floor.

### B. Use Opportunity for Scaling

Currently, Rushing Yards is projected purely on historical Rushing Yards. This is weak. Accuracy improves by projecting **Opportunity** first, then converting it to **Production**.

| Position | Opportunity Metric | Production Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RB** | `rushing_attempts` | `rushing_yards` |
| **WR/TE** | `receiving_targets` | `receiving_receptions` and `receiving_yards` |

**Improvement:**

1.  **Project Opportunity:** Calculate the floor for `rushing_attempts` or `receiving_targets` (the metric that drives usage).
2.  **Calculate Efficiency:** Calculate the player's season-long efficiency: `Yards_Per_Attempt` or `Yards_Per_Target`.
3.  **Final Projection:** `Expected Yards = (Projected Opportunity Floor) √ó (Player Efficiency)`

### C. Utilize Advanced Metrics for QBs

QBs have two new excellent accuracy metrics available in `player_game_stats` that aren't used: **`qbr`** (ESPN's Total QBR) and **`epa_pass`** (Expected Points Added).

**Improvement:** Include `qbr` and `epa_pass` in the `QB` section of `getStatCategories` and calculate floors for these advanced metrics. This provides a more robust measure of overall QB efficiency than just passing yards or fantasy points alone.

-----

## 3\. Code & Structural Improvements (Low Impact/Best Practice)

### A. Optimize Player Fetching

The current method to get a team's roster involves two large queries and multiple array operations to de-duplicate and fetch names.

**Improvement:** Rewrite the player fetching in `calculateFloorsForGame` to use a single, more efficient query by joining the `player_game_stats` table with the `players` table and grouping/filtering by the last `N` weeks directly in SQL.

### B. Add Transactional Safety

Since this script is reading from and writing to the database (although the *write* part is missing), adding a basic `try...finally` block to ensure any open database connections are closed or resources are cleaned up is good practice for a real-world tool.

### C. Refactor Configuration

Move all hardcoded constants used in `calculateStatFloor` (like the `0.4` and `0.6` weighting factors) into the `CONFIG` object for easy tuning and transparency.

| Original | New `CONFIG` Property |
| :--- | :--- |
| `(seasonAvg * 0.4) + (recentAvg * 0.6)` | `season_weight: 0.4`, `recent_weight: 0.6` |

These structural changes will make the model easier to tune and scale as you continue to test its predictive power. I suggest implementing the **Opponent Factor (1A)** first, as it will yield the most immediate accuracy gain.
---
1. Data Quality & Completeness

Issue: The app relies on Supabase tables (games, player_game_stats, etc.), but there‚Äôs no explicit data validation or error handling for missing/incomplete data.
Improvements:

Add pre-calculation checks for data completeness (e.g., ensure all games in a week have stats before running calculations).
Use the existing validation scripts (validate-data-completeness.js, check-games-by-week.js) as pre-requisites before running calculate-performance-floors.js.
Log warnings if min_games_played (currently 2) is not met for a player.




2. Algorithm Refinements

Issue: The floor calculation uses a fixed volatility_factor (0.75) and a simple rolling average.
Improvements:

Dynamic Volatility: Adjust volatility_factor based on player position (e.g., QBs are less volatile than WRs).
Opponent Strength: Incorporate opponent defensive rankings (e.g., fantasy points allowed) into the opponent_modifier.
Recent Trend Weighting: Use exponential weighting for recent games instead of a flat rolling window.




3. Edge Case Handling

Issue: No handling for injured players, bye weeks, or games with unusual conditions (e.g., weather delays).
Improvements:

Skip or flag players with status = 'INJURED' or game.status = 'POSTPONED'.
Add a game_environment_modifier (e.g., dome vs. outdoor, weather conditions).




4. Performance Optimization

Issue: The script fetches data sequentially for each team/player, which is inefficient.
Improvements:

Batch fetch player stats for both teams in a single query.
Cache opponent defensive metrics to avoid repeated calculations.




5. Logging & Debugging

Issue: Console logs are basic and lack actionable insights.
Improvements:

Log input data (e.g., player stats, opponent metrics) for transparency.
Add debug mode to output intermediate values (e.g., Expected, std_dev).




6. Configuration Flexibility

Issue: Hardcoded CONFIG values (e.g., rolling_window_weeks, volatility_factor) limit adaptability.
Improvements:

Move CONFIG to a separate file or environment variables for easy tuning.
Allow overrides for specific players/positions (e.g., volatility_factor = 0.9 for rookies).




7. Documentation & Maintainability

Issue: The code lacks comments for complex logic (e.g., how opponent_modifier is derived).
Improvements:

Document the formula for Expected and Floor in detail.
Add examples for edge cases (e.g., "What if a player has only 1 game in the rolling window?").




8. Testing & Validation

Issue: No automated tests for the floor calculation logic.
Improvements:

Write unit tests for calculateFloorsForGame with mock data (e.g., high/low variance players).
Compare outputs against manual calculations for a sample of players.




9. Security & Access Control

Issue: The Supabase service role key is required, but there‚Äôs no mention of row-level security (RLS).
Improvements:

Ensure RLS policies restrict access to sensitive data (e.g., player injuries).
Use the anon key for read-only operations where possible.




10. Scalability

Issue: The script processes one game at a time.
Improvements:

Add a batch mode to calculate floors for all games in a week.
Parallelize calculations for independent players/teams.




Example Code Snippet for Dynamic Volatility
javascript Copy// Example: Position-based volatility
const POSITION_VOLATILITY = {
  QB: 0.6,
  RB: 0.8,
  WR: 0.9,
  TE: 0.75
};

function getVolatilityFactor(playerPosition) {
  return POSITION_VOLATILITY[playerPosition] || CONFIG.volatility_factor;
}
---
1. Statistical Accuracy Improvements
Use weighted recency instead of fixed rolling window: Apply exponential weighting (e.g., 
w
t
=
e
‚àí
Œª
(
n
‚àí
t
)
w 
t
 =e 
‚àíŒª(n‚àít)
 ) to recent games so last performances influence the floor more proportionally. This avoids sharp cutoff bias in the fixed 3-week window.‚Äã

Normalize opponent difficulty: Adjust player averages by opponent defensive efficiency or defensive position rank, using teamgamestats defensive aggregates (e.g., yards or points allowed per position).‚Äã

Include positional opportunity rate variance: Instead of a static volatility factor, scale volatility by the coefficient of variation of a player‚Äôs opportunity stats (e.g., targets, carries, attempts).‚Äã

Integrate pace and game total context: Pull average drives, total plays, or over/under context from games and teamgamestats tables to refine the expected opportunity volume.‚Äã

Use a Bayesian update model for small sample sizes: For players below mingamesplayed = 2, shrink their estimates toward positional averages rather than skipping them entirely.‚Äã

2. Data Validation and Cleaning Enhancements
Ensure no silent skipping of players: The script skips players with missing or null statistics; instead, fill with zeroes or positional medians to reduce data bias.‚Äã

Outlier detection: Remove one-off statistical outliers using modified Z-scores (>3.5) before computing averages and standard deviation.‚Äã

Sanitize fantasypointsppr inconsistencies: Cross-check with playerseasoncumulativestats totals to catch mismatches between game-level and cumulative totals.‚Äã

Standardize stat type parsing: Implement schema validation against the 303 fields documented in AVAILABLE-DATA-INVENTORY.md to ensure the Supabase client always fetches expected columns.‚Äã

3. Model Consistency and Formula Reassessment
Rethink fixed volatility factor (0.75): Calibrate based on actual league-wide distribution. Derive per-position volatility empirically (QB vs RB vs WR vs TE).‚Äã

Refine confidence score: Include both sample size and variance scaling, but also recent trend directionality (3-game rolling slope of fantasy points or opportunity).‚Äã

Use percentile-based floor instead of standard deviation difference: For instance, 15th percentile historical outcomes provide a more realistic ‚Äúfloor‚Äù than subtracting standard deviation.‚Äã

4. Data Integration and Coverage Expansion
Leverage additional available fields:

Use EPA and Success Rate for trend modeling and opponent adjustment.‚Äã

Include redzone touches, air yards, and yards after catch for opportunity-based projections.‚Äã

Integrate weeklystatleaders and playerseasoncumulativestats as normalization anchors across weeks.‚Äã

Incorporate weather and venue data: Pull stadiums information (open/dome, turf type, capacity) to adjust performance volatility for outdoor/weather-affected games.‚Äã

Cross-table data integrity checks: Compare teamgamestats sums against individual playergamestats totals per game to detect incomplete or partial scrapes.‚Äã

5. Query and Execution Efficiency
Batch Supabase requests: The current loop runs per-player queries; group these by team/week using .in() clauses or RPC functions to reduce latency.‚Äã

Cache computed baselines: Store positional averages and opponent efficiency in a memory object or a dedicated table for reuse during weekly batch runs.‚Äã

Parallelize week calculations: When using calculateFloorsForWeek, wrap game-level calls in a Promise.allSettled() to exploit concurrency safely.‚Äã

6. Explainability and Debug Insight
Add structured logging: Output intermediate metrics (expected, floor, stddev) as JSON for easy downstream visualization and regression audit.‚Äã

Version and persist model assumptions: Save config values (e.g., volatility factor, conservatism) per-run into a small Supabase table for traceability.‚Äã

Summary of Key Improvement Priorities
Category	Top Recommendation	Expected Impact
Statistical Model	Weighted recency + opponent normalization	High
Data Validation	Schema-driven stat validation	High
Confidence Model	Percentile-based floor + Bayesian smoothing	Medium-High
Integration	Use EPA + success rate context	Medium
Efficiency	Batch and cache Supabase queries	Medium
Logging	JSON-based audit logging	Low-Medium
These enhancements will significantly improve accuracy, stability, and interpretability of your performance floor app ‚Äî especially when scaling week-to-week or comparing model drift over the season.
---

Incorporate Opponent Defensive Efficiency (O): The docstring mentions using opponent defensive efficiency in the expected performance formula (Expected = (recent_avg √ó opponent_modifier)), but the code does not implement this. Query the team_game_stats table to calculate the opponent's average allowed stats (e.g., passing yards allowed) over the season or recent games (e.g., last 3 weeks). Divide by league-wide averages (computed from all team_game_stats records) to derive a modifier (e.g., >1.0 for favorable matchups). Multiply the current expected value by this modifier in calculateStatFloor. Use the unused opponentId parameter in calculatePlayerFloors for this query.
Add Game Environment Modifier (G): The docstring references a game environment modifier, which is missing. Incorporate factors like home/away advantage (using games.home_team_id to determine if the player's team is home) or venue effects (query stadiums.surface_type or stadiums.roof_type via games.stadium_id). Apply a small adjustment (e.g., +5% for home games) to the expected value based on historical performance differentials from player_game_stats (e.g., average home vs. away stats for the player or position).
Utilize Opportunity Fields for Volume Projections: The getStatCategories function defines opportunity fields (e.g., passing_attempts, receiving_targets), but they are unused. Project opportunity volume separately (e.g., calculate expected attempts using the same weighted average method), then multiply by efficiency (e.g., yards per attempt from recent/season stats, adjusted for opponent). Combine to derive the stat floor, improving accuracy for variable-usage players like RBs or WRs.
Implement Recent Trend Adjustment (A) Beyond Weighting: The current 60/40 recent/season weighting is basic. Add a trend factor by calculating the slope of recent performance (e.g., linear regression on recentValues using a library like statsmodels via the code_execution tool if needed). Adjust expected upward/downward based on positive/negative trends to better capture momentum.
Expand Player Inclusion for Broader Coverage: Currently, players are only fetched if they have stats in the last 3 weeks (gte('games.week', game.week - 3)), potentially excluding returning injured players or rookies. Query player_season_cumulative_stats for all players with team_id matching and games_played >= CONFIG.min_games_played to include those with earlier-season data. Fall back to season averages if recent data is sparse.
Adjust for Position-Specific Variance (œÉ): The volatility_factor (0.75) is global, but positions have different variances (e.g., WRs are more volatile than QBs). Compute position-specific std_dev from aggregated player_game_stats (grouped by position) and use a dynamic factor (e.g., higher for WR/TE). Also, cap floor at 0 but consider position mins (e.g., QB floor never below 5.0 fantasy points).
Incorporate Advanced Metrics for Refinement: Leverage available advanced fields in player_game_stats (e.g., epa_pass, success_rate, air_yards) to adjust projections. For example, weight expected by recent EPA (e.g., +10% if EPA > league average) for more context-aware floors, especially for QBs and WRs.
Handle Sparse Data More Robustly: If recentValues.length < CONFIG.rolling_window_weeks, reduce the recent weighting (e.g., to 0.3) and rely more on season averages. For players with exactly min_games_played, lower confidence scores further. Add null checks for division-by-zero in calculateConfidence (e.g., if mean === 0, set CV to a max value like 2).
Add League-Wide Normalization: Normalize stats against league averages (queried from player_game_stats or weekly_stat_leaders) to account for season trends (e.g., higher passing in 2025). Adjust expected by a league multiplier for better cross-player comparability.
Improve Confidence Calculation: The current formula is simplistic. Incorporate more factors like games played consistency (e.g., penalize if weeks_active from player_season_cumulative_stats shows bye/injury gaps) or opponent strength in past games. Use a Bayesian approach (e.g., shrink std_dev toward position average for small samples) for more accurate variance.
Validate and Log Data Issues: Add logging in calculateFloorsForGame for cases where data is missing (e.g., no seasonStats). Cross-check against AVAILABLE-DATA-INVENTORY.md for completeness (e.g., ensure Week 7 data is fully populated before running for Week 8). Use the code_execution tool to test queries offline if needed.
Optimize Queries for Efficiency and Accuracy: Batch player stats fetches in calculateTeamFloors (e.g., query all players at once with .in('player_id', uniquePlayerIds) instead of looping). Join with players table earlier to avoid separate queries. Ensure timestamps align with game_date for real-time accuracy (e.g., exclude in-progress games).
Expand to Use Scoring Plays and Leaders Data: For touchdown-heavy stats, query scoring_plays to adjust TD regression (e.g., reduce floor if recent TDs are unsustainable). Use weekly_stat_leaders to benchmark player performance and adjust confidence (e.g., lower if not in top ranks recently).
