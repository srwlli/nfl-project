## What You Need to Do Before Launch

### Critical (Must Fix):

1. **Run weekly-aggregation.js for all weeks** ❗
   - Command: `npm run aggregate:weekly -- --week=1 && npm run aggregate:weekly -- --week=2` (etc.)
   - Populates: weekly_leaders, season_leaders, hot_players tables
   - **Impact**: Stats pages won't show leaders without this

2. **Run advanced-analytics-scraper.js for Weeks 1-6** ❗
   - Command: `npm run scrape:analytics -- --week=1` (repeat for 2-6)
   - Populates: play_by_play table with EPA/WPA for all completed games
   - **Impact**: Play-by-play pages will only show Week 7 data

3. **Investigate player_injury_status empty table** ❗
   - injuries-scraper.js ran successfully (690 records logged)
   - But table shows 0 records
   - **Impact**: Injury reports won't display on game pages

4. **Fix Washington (WSH) team_id FK error** ❗
   - Team ID "WSH" not found in teams table (should be "WAS")
   - Add team alias: WSH → WAS
   - **Impact**: Washington roster updates failing

5. **Drop obsolete player_season_stats table** (Minor)
   - Run SQL: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS player_season_stats CASCADE;`
   - Via Supabase SQL Editor: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/fuzouuxhxluqjmiyabal/sql/new
   - **Impact**: Schema cleanup only

### Important (Should Add):

6. **Implement player awards tracking**
   - Create player_awards table (MVP, Pro Bowl, All-Pro)
   - Backfill from sports-reference.com or manual curation
   - **Impact**: Player profile pages missing trophy case

7. **Add milestone detection logic**
   - Calculate 100-yard games, 5+ TDs, career milestones
   - Display on game pages and player profiles
   - **Impact**: Missing "Player Milestones" section

8. **Integrate weather forecast API**
   - OpenWeatherMap or Weather.com
   - For scheduled games only
   - **Impact**: Scheduled game pages missing weather

### Nice-to-Have (Can Add Later):

9. **Implement video highlights integration**
   - ESPN API video endpoints
   - Manual curation
   - **Impact**: No video highlights on game pages

10. **Add Next Gen Stats**
    - Requires NFL Next Gen Stats API (paid)
    - Average time to throw, air yards, etc.
    - **Impact**: Player profiles missing advanced metrics

11. **Implement playoff probability calculator**
    - Use FiveThirtyEight model or custom logic
    - **Impact**: Season context missing playoff odds
